Amy: You've already given me the greatest present!
kazuma: Wha, Amy?! How long have you been there?!
Amy: From the very beginning. 
Amy: I noticed Mia was trying to hide something from me and got a little worried.

Amy: Mia, are you okay? No injuries, I hope? Burns?
miia: A-Amy, what are ya doin' here?
Amy: That's of no matter. 
Amy: Tell me, are you hurt?

miia: But the cake's charred and your surprise is ruined. Sorry, Amy. 
miia: I was hoping to make your day special.
Amy: No need to apologize.

Amy: Let's make another cake—together. I can't imagine a better birthday memory.
miia: Aw, Amy... 
miia: Sure thing! Let's do it! 
miia: And happy birthday!
kazuma: The surprise might not have worked out, but I don't think these two would have it any other way.
kazuma: Happy birthday, Amy!
