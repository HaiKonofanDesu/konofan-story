Mia - P2
ナレーション: One day, Mia and Amy were selling vegetables at their stand in Axel...
miia: Welcome, take a look! These veggies came from the north. Buy 'em all up before they sell out!
Amy: Mia, you need to be nicer with your sales pitch.
Customer A: Don't worry, we're all used to it. Your vegetables are always fresh and tasty, so I think I'll buy some.
Customer B: Me, too. Some cabbage, please.
miia: Thanks as always! Buh-bye!
Amy: Whew... It looks like the customers are all gone for now. Let's pack everything up, Mia.
miia: Huh? We usually work later... Are we done for the day?
Amy: We sold a lot today. If we close up, I can get supper started early. It'll be quite the feast!
miia: Will there be meat buns?
Amy: Hehe, I'll make meat buns for you.
miia: Yay, I can't wait! I'll tidy up here so you can get on those meat buns!
Amy: That's a good girl. I'll leave the stand to you, then.\n
Amy: Just be home in time for supper.
miia: I guess I'm on my own now.
miia: I know what Amy said, but supper's not for a while yet. I'll just keep selling veggies!
miia: Yeah! And if I buy her a present with the money I make... 
miia: She's sure to be thrilled!
miia: Come take a look! We've got fresh veggies from the north! They're a real bargain, too!
lean: Look, Dust. Mia's selling vegetables.
dust: Veggies? Forget it. Bring on the meat already!
lean: Hey, watch what you're saying.\n
lean: She's right there!
miia: Don't worry about it. I may sell vegetables for a living, but I prefer meat, too.
lean: You're pretty mature for a kid. 
lean: Okay, let's see... Can I have a tomato, please?
miia: One tomato? Sure, I guess...
miia: *Stare*
lean: Hm? What's wrong? Is there something on my shirt?
miia: Um... I'll just tell you straight up. Eating tomatoes won't give you a chest like Amy's.
lean: Huh?! Th-that isn't why I want them!
dust: Hahaha! Guess that was a deep cut, Rin! What you need is milk, not tomatoes!
miia: Milk from the north is super fresh and delicious. Amy said that drinking it helped her grow nice and big!
dust: Ahahaha! You hear that? How about it, Rin? Makes you wanna go up north, doesn't it?
lean: Oh yeah, sure. You want to head up north first? I'll punch your stupid face so hard, you'll fly there!
dust: Hehehe... I was only joking, ya know. Oh, that reminds me! 
dust: I've got something important to take care of! Later!
lean: Wait, Dust... 
lean: There he goes. Right in the middle of buying something, too.
miia: So...are you buying that tomato?
lean: Yeah, I'll take it.
miia: Here ya are! Buh-bye!
Customer C: One radish, miss. And a cabbage too...a nice big one!
miia: Hm? Well, isn't your head all smooth and shiny!\n
miia: You should buy seaweed instead. It helps grow hair!
Customer C: What did you say?!
lean: Mia, you know you can't say stuff like that, right?
lean: I'm so sorry, sir. One radish, was it?\n
lean: There you are. You can pay here.
Customer C: Hmph. Well, as long as you understand now.
miia: He sure was mad. I only told him the truth!
lean: Some things you should keep to yourself, even if they're true. Like that stuff about my chest.
miia: I see... Sorry. I heard that lying is bad, so...
lean: Y-you're not wrong, but...
lean: I guess there are problems when Amy isn't around. Where is she today, anyway?
miia: She went home early to cook supper for us.
miia: So I'm handling things by myself here! I'll use the money we earn to buy Amy a present!
lean: So that was your plan. You're awfully kind.\n
lean: Dust could learn a lot from you.
lean: Okay, I'll give you a hand, then.
lean: Welcome! We have fresh vegetables from the north here! 
lean: But they're going fast!
miia: Thanks, Rin! 
miia: That's really nice of you!
miia: Step right up! Come buy some super tasty veggies!
kazuma: Hm? Oh, it's Mia and Rin. I don't see you two together that often.
miia: Hey, Kazuma. Welcome!
miia: Buy some vegetables for tonight's dinner. If you do, I can get a present for Amy!
kazuma: That's quite a direct sales tactic. 
kazuma: Okay, I'll buy something.
miia: Ooh! You will, Kazuma?
Customer D: Say, those veggies look good. I'll take some, too.
lean: Of course! Thank you very much!
lean: We sold them all. Good work!
miia: Yay! Now I can buy a present!
miia: Thanks, Rin. Your chest may be small, but your heart's big!
lean: H-hey, I told you! You shouldn't talk about people's chests!
miia: R-right... You just told me, but I forgot. I'm sorry, Rin. I hope I didn't hurt you.
lean: Forget it... Why don't you go and buy that present? The shops will be closing soon.
miia: Yeah, I suppose they will. 
miia: But what should I get her?
lean: It's the thought that counts, so anything should be okay. Get her something she likes, and she'll be happy.
miia: Something that Amy likes... Hmm...
lean: There's gotta be something.
miia: Oh, Amy likes vegetables! I'll buy some for her, then!
lean: Wait, Mia! Why buy vegetables with money you got from selling vegetables? Isn't that weird?
ナレーション: While Mia did not end up getting a present for Amy, her hard work was the best present Amy could ask for...
