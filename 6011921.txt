Amy: I'll get them. Wait a moment while I cut the cake.
megumin: Aren't you working too hard? Today's your birthday, leave everything to us!

Amy: I'm more comfortable if everyone else is sitting.
kazuma: You're just too nice, huh... 
kazuma: Well, that's just like you Amy.
miia: Amy! Try some of this fried chicken! I made it myself!
Amy: Y-You made this for me, Mia?! Even though you're always hungry, you still cooked for me...
Amy: I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much, Mia! You could be a chef, making something like this!
miia: Hurry up! Fried chicken's best straight outta the fryer! It smells so good... 
miia: *Drool*
Amy: Hehe, you're so cute when you're hungry, Mia. 
Amy: Do you want some of mine? Here.
miia: B-But, this is yours, Amy... 
Amy: Just the thought is enough for me. Now, eat up!
miia: ...Well, if you say so Amy, 
miia: I'll eat it! *Chomp*
Amy: Hehe, you don't need to wolf it down. Want some cake too?
miia: Yes!
aqua: Amy! Can I get a refill?
Amy: Of course, just a moment.
megumin: *Sigh* I can't tell whose birthday this is supposed to be.
kazuma: Amy seems happy, so I guess it's fine, right?
Amy: Hehe... Everyone, thank you for today.
