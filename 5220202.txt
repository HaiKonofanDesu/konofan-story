Stylish Transformation! Special Outfit Recruit
lia_gendai: It feels like everyone's staring. 
lia_gendai: How nerve wracking. 
mitsurugi_gendai: It's natural for them to be curious. 
mitsurugi_gendai: You don't see people wearing outfits like these around here.
lia_gendai: Kazuma's really the only one who still wears clothes from his own world. 
mitsurugi_gendai: Haha, his tracksuit! 
mitsurugi_gendai: It's strange how weird my casual clothes feel when 
mitsurugi_gendai: I used to dress like this every day. 
lia_gendai: I totally get you. It makes me kind of fidgety and awkward. 
lia_gendai: I guess that just goes to show how comfortable we've gotten here.
mitsurugi_gendai: Do you ever wish you could go back, Lia? 
lia_gendai: Go back home? 
lia_gendai: Hmm, that's a loaded question. 
lia_gendai: I think I like it here though! 
lia_gendai: Our fans here mean so much to me now. 
lia_gendai: And it might get a little crazy here and there, 
lia_gendai: but it's really been a lot of fun. 
mitsurugi_gendai: I must agree. 
mitsurugi_gendai: We also have an incredibly important missionâ€”to save people and defeat the Devil King. 
mitsurugi_gendai: I feel endless gratitude to the Goddess for choosing me. 
mitsurugi_gendai: I'm determined to repay her kindness. 
lia_gendai: Hehe... That silly line actually sounds authentic today, for some reason. 
lia_gendai: I guess I should try and do my best too!
