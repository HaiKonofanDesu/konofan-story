A New Year for This Starter Town! - P3
megumin_newyear: Come, my explosive kite! Dance ever higher upon the wind!
darkness_newyear: This is amazing! How can it go so high into the air without magic?
kazuma_newyear: Don't worry about how it works! You're just 
kazuma_newyear: supposed to be having fun!
aqua_newyear: Now, feast your eyes upon the amazing Aqua's original top 
aqua_newyear: spinning technique, the "New Year's Goddess Tightrope!"
Patron A: What an ingenious performance! What did she call that thing? A top? I've never seen such a device!
Patron B: This is why Axel is known for having the best street performers in the world!
Patron C: These professionals are on a completely different level!
kazuma_newyear: Aqua, celebrity is great and everything, but is this really all you want to do today?
aqua_newyear: Oh, you're right. There's still so much left to do... 
aqua_newyear: We should play some badminton, then a few rounds of karuta...
aqua_newyear: Oh, I know! Since it's nearly lunch time, let's all have 
aqua_newyear: some delicious mochi!
kazuma_newyear: All finished. Feast your eyes on my mochi set!
aqua_newyear: We'll be able to make some proper mochi with this.
kazuma_newyear: First you put the rice into the millstone like this, then you hit it with a mallet until it's nice and soft.
megumin_newyear: So this is what the people from your homeland make for the 
megumin_newyear: new year? Life sure is full of interesting customs.
kazuma_newyear: All right, Darkness. Make sure to pay attention to your timing or I'll end up crushing your hand with the mallet.
darkness_newyear: Right, leave it to me. But even if I do make a mistake, I'll just consider that 
darkness_newyear: its own kind of reward!
kazuma_newyear: Hey, Aqua. Swap places with Darkness, will you?
darkness_newyear: But why?!
kazuma_newyear: Because you'll just mess up on purpose!
aqua_newyear: Very well, I suppose I can help. Watch closely, Darkness. 
aqua_newyear: I'll show you the proper way to do this!
kazuma_newyear: Ready? 
kazuma_newyear: Here we go!
kazuma_newyear: One!
aqua_newyear: Two!
kazuma_newyear: One!
aqua_newyear: Two!
megumin_newyear: Amazing! Look how fast they're going! It's like watching 
megumin_newyear: the swordplay of a legendary knight!
darkness_newyear: Oh, look at it getting beaten and crushed like that... 
darkness_newyear: I'm so envious. It must be wonderful to be mochi...
kazuma_newyear: How can you possibly get that excited from watching us make mochi?! Just how perverse are you?!
？？？: Awooo...
aqua_newyear: Phew... Huh? What was that? Hey Megumin, I think I might've 
aqua_newyear: heard Chomusuke howling just now.
megumin_newyear: Chomusuke does not howl.
Lion Dancer Cub: Awooo!
darkness_newyear: Wha—?! How did a lion dancer 
darkness_newyear: get this far into town?!
kazuma_newyear: Calm down, Darkness. But how do you know about lion dancers 
kazuma_newyear: when you don't have any other New Year's customs?
megumin_newyear: How can you be so calm about this, Kazuma?! It must have 
megumin_newyear: wandered into town after getting separated from its pack!
kazuma_newyear: The two of you are overreacting. You're not a child. You should know by now they're just costumes. 
kazuma_newyear: It sure is small for a lion dancer, though...
kazuma_newyear: Is this one made for kids or something? Hey, how would you like some candy?
darkness_newyear: Kazuma, get back! It's dangerous!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Chomp*
kazuma_newyear: Yeooouuuch!!! 
kazuma_newyear: My leg! My leg!!!
darkness_newyear: We told you it was dangerous! Lion dancers are known for their powerful bites.
kazuma_newyear: You're not supposed to bite down this hard when you're playing! L-Let go! 
kazuma_newyear: Hey, are listening to me in there?!
aqua_newyear: Kazuma, since you don't seem to know, allow me to explain. The lion dancers in this world 
aqua_newyear: do not have people inside them! Well, not living ones, anyway.
kazuma_newyear: Huh?! What the heck are you talking about?!
megumin_newyear: Aqua is simply stating facts! I'm more surprised that you never knew about them!
kazuma_newyear: Huh? 
aqua_newyear: Lion dancers are fierce monsters who rarely let go after biting their victims! 
aqua_newyear: They're extremely dangerous!
kazuma_newyear: A-A-Again with the complete backwardness?! This is exactly the kind of thing that makes me 
kazuma_newyear: hate this world so much!
