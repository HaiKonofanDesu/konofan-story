<size=35>Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? III Collaboration</size>
aqua_D: Hey, Bell! Look! I made an outfit just like Hestia's!
bell: Wow, you look great! 
bell: For a second, I thought there was another Goddess here!
hestia: Hold it right there, Bell. It's true that Aqua looks great, 
hestia: but saying she looks like me is a step too far.
hestia: There's no way anybody looks better in this outfit than me. 
hestia: Isn't that right?!
bell: Um, well...
aiz: What are you three talking about?
bell: Oh, Ais! You've got great timing—
bell: What the heck?! Why are there two are you as well?!
darkness_D: Sorry for startling you. 
darkness_D: Aqua made me an outfit just like Ais's, so I thought I'd try it on.
aqua_D: Looks like it was good enough to fool Bell, too! 
aqua_D: I guess that just proves how amazing my sewing skills are!
darkness_D: True. It's quite comfortable and easy to move around in as well. I could get used to this.
bell: Uh...
bell: What's happening to me? I know that it's Darkness, but they look almost like twins. My heart is beating like crazy...
darkness_D: What's the matter, Bell? You seem distracted.
aiz: Your face is red.
bell: Wha—?! I-It's nothing!
hestia: ...
hestia: Bell, you big cheater!
bell: Huh?!
hestia: Staring at Wallenwhatsit and Darkness with that stupid look on your face! 
hestia: You won't even answer my simple question!
hestia: Fine, then! I don't need you... 
hestia: I don't... Waaaaaah!
bell: Goddess! 
bell: Where are you going?!
darkness_D: What's gotten into Hestia?
aqua_D: No clue. 
aqua_D: Anyway, I know Hestia took off, but I've got my magic camera here! 
aqua_D: Let's capture the moment with a photo!
aiz: What is a magic camera?
aqua_D: Don't worry, just look over there and smile! C'mon, you two! Move in a bit closer... 
aqua_D: And say cheese!
ナレーション: Aqua kept the photo in her box of treasures, so she would always remember her adventures with Ais and the others...
