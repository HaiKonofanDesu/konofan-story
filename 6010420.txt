God's Blessing on Chris's Birthday! (2021)
ナレーション: On the birthday of the goddess Eris, Darkness invited Chris over to the mansion...
chris: Heya! Thanks for having me.
darkness: Come right in, Chris.
aqua: How's it going, you two? 
aqua: ...Wait, don't tell me you're celebrating Eris's birthday! Ugh, what a hokey holiday! 
aqua: There are other places you can sully with such festivities, you know!
darkness: Don't worry. We'll celebrate Eris elsewhere. I invited Chris 
darkness: over for something entirely different—something important. 
darkness: You see, she was my first partymate, and a dear friend. 
darkness: And today happens to be her birthday as well!
kazuma: Ya don't say? Congrats, Chris!
chris: Heh. 
chris: Strange how a simple greeting can make you feel bashful.
aqua: You and Eris share birthdays? Huh. How...uncanny.
megumin: This would call for a celebratory dinner...if we had anything 
megumin: left in the pantry.
darkness: Don't fret, I stocked up on food and bubbly earlier! Even brought some quality meat from my estate.
kazuma: Sounds delicious! 
kazuma: I'll handle the cooking!
megumin: And I'll handle the taste testing!
aqua: And I'll check the bubbly for poison!
kazuma: ...You idiots just wanna gorge yourselves.
chris: I see your party's lively as ever, Darkness.
darkness: Always. And the reason I'm blessed with such excellent comrades is because you vouched for me. 
darkness: Thank you.
chris: Hey, I should be thanking you! I've never had anyone celebrate 
chris: my birthday so boisterously before. It's nice.
darkness: I'm glad to hear it. 
darkness: Because it's about to get much louder!
Everyone: Happy birthday, Chris!
chris: Hehe. Thanks, everyone! Now let's party!
ナレーション: And so commenced a raucous birthday celebration that lasted well into the night...
