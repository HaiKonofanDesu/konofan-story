First Anniversary Episode (4 day prior)
melissa: In four days, it'll have been a year... 
melissa: I haven't forgotten. You stole that jewel from me in the noble's mansion.
chris: U-Um, you seem to be misunderstanding some things... 
chris: That wasn't a jewel, it was a dangerous magic item.
melissa: It's no use trying to fool me. I'm going to get it back.
melissa: You may have raw talent, 
melissa: but I have more experience. I've slain lizard runners, mastered the martial arts...
chris: W-Well I've done a lot too! 
chris: What theâ€”?!
chris: Now that I think about it, it's all stuff that has nothing to do with my job, like that casino or skating!
melissa: Hmph, you're slacking. The next treasure we find is mine. 
melissa: On my pride as a treasure hunter, I won't lose to you!
