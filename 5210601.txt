Snow Country Festival
ナレーション: Samuidoh's yearly Harvest Festival had arrived, and Amy and Mia were sporting their traditional festival garments.
Amy_samuido: Mia, sweetie, you look gorgeous! 
Amy_samuido: Would you mind if I hugged you?
miia_samuido: A-
miia_samuido: Amy? 
miia_samuido: I haven't said anythin' yet, but sure, okay.
Amy_samuido: Oh, yes. Sorry.
Amy_samuido: That outfit suits you perfectly, dear. 
Amy_samuido: It was well worth resizing for you.
Amy_samuido: But are my old clothes really what you wanted? I could have put together something new, you know?
miia_samuido: Nope, these are the threads for me! 
miia_samuido: I remember you dancin' in 'em before. You looked super cool!
Amy_samuido: Oh! 
Amy_samuido: There's nothing like a compliment from my little angel!
miia_samuido: I may be little, but not for long! I'll grow faster than a prairie fire with a tail wind. Bigger 'an you! ...Everywhere.
Amy_samuido: Hehe... Oh, Mia...
Amy_samuido: But if Mia grows up...
Amy_samuido: She'd be independent. Then I'd just get in the way. She wouldn't need me anymore! 
Amy_samuido: I-I can't bear the thought!
miia_samuido: Hm? What's wrong, Amy?
Amy_samuido: I was imagining you all grown up. Thinking that maybe... You wouldn't want me around anymore. Oh, it's too much!
miia_samuido: Aw, what're ya sayin'? Me gettin' big won't change nothin'. 
miia_samuido: You and me, we'll be together forever!
Amy_samuido: Really? Forever and ever? You promise?
miia_samuido: Ya don't gotta repeat yourself! I already said we would! 
miia_samuido: But gettin' dressed up's got me hungry.
Amy_samuido: It is about time for a snack. What would you like?
miia_samuido: A slice o' your homemade cake, please!  
miia_samuido: Oh, but I could go for cookies. And some gelatin sounds good too.
Amy_samuido: Decisions, decisions... 
Amy_samuido: How about we make them all, then?
