chris: Can you at least tell me why we're here?
melissa: The details don't concern you. 
melissa: You promised me your aid, did you not?
chris: Well, yeah, but...
melissa: My plan is completely foolproof. Trust it. 
melissa: Now, enough small talk. Look ahead.
ナレーション: Having abruptly coaxed Chris into coming with her on a quest, Melissa pointed to a mountain in the distance.
melissa: There's a wyvern den on the peak.
chris: Up there, eh? 
chris: So, we're going to steal its eggs. For what? Cooking? Do you even cook, Melissa?
melissa: Oh, so you know what they're used for.
chris: Darkness filled me in. Wyvern eggs are a valuable ingredient to high-class gourmands—an essential part of aristocratic banquets.
chris: Given their rarity, I guess you're planning to sell the eggs to some loaded noble?
melissa: Nope. It's a short and simple quest, really. I get the eggs for the client. 
melissa: They're not for me.
chris: Oh... 
chris: Well, the pay must be amazing then, eh?
melissa: Is that a rhetorical question? I mean, who the heck do you think I am? 
melissa: Let's make for the summit. Time is wasting.
chris: Hey Melissa, wait up!
chris: Whoa. You're splitting half the reward with me?!
melissa: Keep your voice down! We're near the wyvern den. Things'll get ugly if we're detected—fast.
chris: Right, sorry. 
chris: But, I mean, this isn't like you at all. 
chris: "You get zilch." 
chris: Is what I'd expect you to say...
melissa: The percentage you get is not undeserved. 
melissa: I'm calm, calculating, and this plan is foolproof. Or did you forget?
chris: No, I didn't... 
chris: I just feel like I'm missing something.
melissa: Bingo. Found the eggs.
chris: Then let's bag the things and split.
？？？: Grrrrrrrrr...
melissa: Chris, behind you!
chris: Huh?!
Wyvern: Rrraaawwwrrr!!!
chris: Whoa! 
chris: That was too close for comfort!
melissa: Impressive. Evading a strike like that at point-blank range is no easy feat.
chris: Lucky you gave me a heads up. 
chris: Now, how about we whack us some wyvern, hm?
melissa: My thoughts exactly. Let's be quick about it.
Wyvern: Rrraaarrrghhh!!!
