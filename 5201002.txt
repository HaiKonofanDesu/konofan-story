Mighty Martial Arts Girls
ナレーション: Lia and Melissa decided that a special training event would be the perfect thing to get in better shape...
lia_china: Hraaah! Hroh! 
lia_china: Hyaaah!
melissa_china: Phew... 
melissa_china: You're not half bad. 
melissa_china: I should've expected as much from a dancer.
lia_china: You've got amazing endurance yourself, 
lia_china: Melissa.
lia_china: I thought my dance practices would have prepared me, 
lia_china: but I'm already out of breath. You're barely even sweating!
melissa_china: I may not show it on the outside, but I'm exhausted too. 
melissa_china: Learning martial arts is harder than I'd expected.
lia_china: Yeah, Aqua taught me a little after I asked how she stayed in shape. Especially since she drinks so much. 
lia_china: Though, I'm not sure I'm doing it right.
melissa_china: It's certainly effective core training. Still...
melissa_china: is it really necessary to dress like this?
lia_china: Well... I don't know, 
lia_china: but she worked hard making these. I'd feel bad if we didn't wear them at least once.
melissa_china: Well, so long as I get a good workout, I'm fine with it.
lia_china: I'm a little surprised, though. I didn't expect that you'd train like this with me.
lia_china: You're always so poised, I thought you'd hate this kind of training.
melissa_china: Heh... If you want to be the best, you have to put in the work!
melissa_china: Beauty is a tremendous weapon, but it takes a lot of effort. Especially if you want to turn any man you meet into your willing servant!
lia_china: My willing servant...?
melissa_china: With how zealous your fans are, you could pull it 
melissa_china: off in no time. Want me to show you how?
lia_china: Um... I think that might be a bit much for me.
melissa_china: Too bad. Shall we get back to our training, then? 
melissa_china: The way to the top is one step at a time!
lia_china: You're right—even Cielo practices the martial arts. This is sure to help with my dancing.
melissa_china: Then let's get back to it!
Lia, Melissa: Haaah! Hoh! Hyaaah!
ナレーション: Lia and Melissa trained late into the night...
