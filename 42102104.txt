lia_valentine: I've decided I'm going to make some chocolate cookies.
wiz_valentine: In that case, I'll make a chocolate cake.
iris_valentine: I'm not sure...
clair: Lady Iris, you only just started baking. It might be best not to attempt anything overly complicated.
iris_valentine: But I want Kazuma to like my gift as well...
wiz_valentine: How about some chocolate truffles, then? They're fairly 
wiz_valentine: simple to make and also quite delicious.
iris_valentine: Chocolate truffles? 
iris_valentine: All right! I'll give it a try!
clair: Ah! I can't believe how cute Lady Iris is in her baking 
clair: outfit! Kazuma Satou, just this once, you have my gratitude!
lia_valentine: Claire, are you all right? Your breathing is a little labored.
clair: O-Oh, it's nothing! I'm simply excited to see what everyone 
clair: will make.
cecily_valentine: Hehehe... This is coming along nicely. Now to mix in a bit 
cecily_valentine: of chocolate, and a few secret ingredients...
lia_valentine: Hey, Cecily. That IS chocolate that you're making, right?
cecily_valentine: Ahh! Lia, don't sneak up on me like that!
lia_valentine: S-Sorry! I didn't realize you were so focused.
cecily_valentine: My recipe requires a delicate touch and the utmost concentration!
lia_valentine: A delicate touch...?
lia_valentine: You ARE making chocolate, right?

cecily_valentine: final product. How is yours coming along, Lia?
lia_valentine: I decided to make some chocolate cookies. I'm just waiting for them to bake at the moment.
cecily_valentine: Cookies, huh? I hope you'll give me a taste when they're finished.
iris_valentine: Whoops! 
iris_valentine: It fell apart again. Baking sure is a lot more difficult than I expected...
clair: L-Lady Iris, are you all right?! 
clair: Are you hurt?!
iris_valentine: No need to make a fuss. I'm just shaping chocolate.
clair: Still, when I imagine something going wrong in here and causing you harm, I just...
iris_valentine: Please have faith in me, Claire. I want to see this through to the end!
clair: Lady Iris...
wiz_valentine: There's no need to worry, Claire. We're all keeping an eye on Lady Iris.

clair: you finish your chocolates, Lady Iris.
iris_valentine: Thank you. I just hope you like them!
wiz_valentine: Okay, Lady Iris. Let's start at the beginning and shape the chocolate again. We'll do it together this time.
iris_valentine: That would be wonderful!
ナレーション: A few hours later...
lia_valentine: Claire, could you try these?
iris_valentine: Please give us your honest opinion.
clair: I understand. All right, let's see...
wiz_valentine: How are they?
clair: These rival the masterpieces crafted by the patissiers that cater to the royal family! I'm sure Kazuma will be pleased.
wiz_valentine: We did it, Lia! Lady Iris!
lia_valentine: Wonderful. 
lia_valentine: Now we can finally take a breather.
iris_valentine: I couldn't have finished my truffles without your 
iris_valentine: assistance. Thank you so much, everyone!
clair: Lady Iris's chocolates were definitely my favorite! I don't 
clair: think one million Eris per truffle would be too much to—
iris_valentine: Let's go give Kazuma his chocolates!
clair: Oh, but I wasn't finished with my feedback...
lia_valentine: Let's get Aqua and the others and all go together.
wiz_valentine: Yes, we can all—Huh? 
wiz_valentine: Now that you mention it, where did Cecily go?
ナレーション: As Wiz and the others were celebrating their success in the kitchen, Cecily was alone in the gardens...
cecily_valentine: Almost there...
cecily_valentine: Just a little more and my brand new jelly slime will be finished!
cecily_valentine: Hahahaha!!!
