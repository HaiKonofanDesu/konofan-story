chris_winter: This is great. It really warms you to the bone. 
chris_winter: What is it?
kazuma_winter: It's a popular dish from back home called ramen. Boil some noodles, toss 'em in soup, and top with whatever you like.
kazuma_winter: I used pork bones in the broth for a deeper flavor. What do you think?
squall: This is the first time I've tasted such a dish, but the richness is rather delightful. 
kazuma_winter: I'm glad you like it. There's plenty more, so eat up!
miia: In that case, I'll take some more of the roasted pork!
chris_winter: Can I get a second helping of noodles?!
kazuma_winter: Coming right up!

kazuma: How is that any different than when we're in Axel?!
