Legendary Adventurer Festival
Megumin, Wiz: HAHAHAHAHA!
megumin_fest: It is I, Megumin, master of the explosive arts—the pinnacle of enchanted attacks!
megumin_fest: Dare thee witness my powers with thine own eyes? 
megumin_fest: To behold such greatness would be to unwittingly suborn yourself to my grand saga.
wiz_fest: M-My name is Wiz! 
wiz_fest: Pleased to, er, meet you. My body is an instrument of darkness itself, 
wiz_fest: and, uh...
megumin_fest: Wiz, c'mon. For the umpteenth time, learn your lines. 
megumin_fest: And lose the "Pleased to meet you"—this is no warm greeting!
wiz_fest: Sorry, so sorry! I just can't wrap my head around this 
wiz_fest: Crimson Demon style of self-introduction.
megumin_fest: Can't you? Kazuma and Aqua went through painstaking trouble to procure these costumes.
megumin_fest: If we look like legends, 
megumin_fest: then we need to declare ourselves! 
megumin_fest: The world must recognize our greatness! 
megumin_fest: This is the Crimson Demon way!
wiz_fest: But I'm not a Crimson Demon...
darkness_fest: Is everything all right in there? I'm coming in.
aqua_fest: Oh, you're already changed. 
aqua_fest: You were taking so long we were starting to worry.
megumin_fest: We were working on our entrance lines. A cool entrance is customary before engaging monsters on the field of battle.
kazuma_fest: No...it's really not.
darkness_fest: Regardless, daylight is limited. If we don't finish this quest, donning these costumes will have been meaningless.
wiz_fest: S-Sorry! I'll get going, right away!
megumin_fest: Hey, you can't just up and leave! What about your lines?
kazuma_fest: She can improvise them on the way. Now let's go!
megumin_fest: Hey, no pulling! 
megumin_fest: These are new threads, if you didn't know!
wiz_fest: Sorry, Megumin, but a Crimson Demon entrance is just 
wiz_fest: way too much for me.
ナレーション: Wiz went on to defeat many a monster in the field—and did not once utter a line to Megumin's liking.
