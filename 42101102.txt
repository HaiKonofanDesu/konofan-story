A New Year for This Starter Town! - P2
kazuma_newyear: Ah... So warm...
megumin_newyear: Um, Kazuma? I thought you said you were going to show us how to enjoy the New Year's holiday.
darkness_newyear: Yes, I was wondering the same thing. How is this different from what you usually do?
kazuma_newyear: What are you talking about? I've already explained! Staying at home and taking it easy 
kazuma_newyear: is what New Year's is all about!
megumin_newyear: This is not at all what I was expecting! I'm bored!
darkness_newyear: If we never get out from under the kotatsu, what is the point of wearing these furisode?
aqua_newyear: *Sigh* It was stupid of me to expect more from Kazuma! 
aqua_newyear: Looks like I've got to take matters into my own hands!
aqua_newyear: I'll make sure we enjoy the holiday properly!
kazuma_newyear: You say that, but what are you planning on doing? 
aqua_newyear: That's obvious... 
aqua_newyear: New Year's calligraphy!
darkness_newyear: These calligraphy brushes are quite difficult to use.
kazuma_newyear: Careful not to use too much water, or the ink will spread across the paper and look blotchy.
kazuma_newyear: ...I can't believe she prepared 
kazuma_newyear: proper ink and brushes.
aqua_newyear: Do you have any idea how much I've been looking forward to 
aqua_newyear: New Year's? I've been counting down the days for weeks!
megumin_newyear: Explosions, explosions, boom boom boom! ♪
darkness_newyear: Wow, Megumin. Your brush strokes are so smooth!
aqua_newyear: Next, write a word that embodies your New Year's resolution! Don't worry about being perfect— 
aqua_newyear: Just write with feeling!
megumin_newyear: Yah! Hoooooo—yah!
megumin_newyear: There, it's finished! I'm rather proud of this one! What do you think, Kazuma?!
kazuma_newyear: ..."Explosion"?
megumin_newyear: Exactly! It symbolizes my determination to push the boundaries of the explosive arts even further this year!
darkness_newyear: I'm finished as well. It's actually quite refreshing putting so much effort into writing a single word.
kazuma_newyear: ..."Wall"?
darkness_newyear: That's right, Kazuma. I'll absorb punishment as the party's wall once again this year!
kazuma_newyear: Uh, right... You're not wasting any time with the crazy 
kazuma_newyear: this year, are you?
aqua_newyear: B...u...b...b...l...y... 
aqua_newyear: There! All done!
kazuma_newyear: You're supposed to write your New Year's resolution! You already drink plenty of bubbly!
aqua_newyear: No, I have no intention of becoming complacent! I vow to drink even more high-quality 
aqua_newyear: bubbly than ever before!
megumin_newyear: Kazuma, it looks like you already finished, too. What did you write?
kazuma_newyear: "Tranquility." My wish is to sit back and 
kazuma_newyear: relax every day of the year.
megumin_newyear: Come on, Kazuma. If all you want to do is crawl back under the kotatsu, you have no right to criticize Aqua.
kazuma_newyear: Say whatever you want. 
kazuma_newyear: All right, calligraphy is finished. You happy? 
kazuma_newyear: Now it's time to get back to relaxing.
aqua_newyear: Hold it right there! We're nowhere near finished yet! 
aqua_newyear: New Year's is just getting started!
kazuma_newyear: You keep saying that, but it's not like we can just jump up and do something when we don't have anything prepared.
kazuma_newyear: If we're talking New Year's activities, 
kazuma_newyear: I guess there's kite 
kazuma_newyear: flying, but I've never seen anywhere that sells them here.
aqua_newyear: Heh! I thought you might say something like that, so I took the liberty of buying the materials to make one!
kazuma_newyear: Seriously?!
aqua_newyear: Now, Kazuma! Your job is to take these materials and construct a splendid kite for us to fly!
kazuma_newyear: You'd better be lending me a hand!
aqua_newyear: I would really like to help, 
aqua_newyear: but I'm afraid I can't!
aqua_newyear: You see, I have to take this traditional top here and teach everyone the amazing wonders of top spinning.
aqua_newyear: Come on, Megumin, Darkness. Let's go into town 
aqua_newyear: so Kazuma can focus on making the kite.
megumin_newyear: Hey! Wait for us, Aqua!
darkness_newyear: See you in town, Kazuma! I'm really looking forward 
darkness_newyear: to seeing how flying a kite works.
kazuma_newyear: There they go... 
kazuma_newyear: I wish that useless goddess would put this much effort into things that actually mattered.
