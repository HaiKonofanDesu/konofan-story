ynyn: Yeah, you're not just an adventurer, but a dancer too. You're amazingâ€”always making so many people happy.
lia: Thank you, but I couldn't do it alone. I get plenty of help from Cielo and Erika.
ynyn: Friends you can count on... 
ynyn: I'm so jealous.
lia: There's nothing to be jealous of! You had fun at Halloween, you performed in that play... 
lia: You have friends too, Yunyun.
ynyn: Y-You think so? But they've never actually said that we're friends, so I'm not really sure... 
ynyn: So I'll do my best so that they'll call me their friend in the future!
lia: I think they already consider Yunyun their friend... 
lia: If she spends more time with them, maybe she'll notice.
