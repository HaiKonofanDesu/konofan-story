True Pals for This Prankster Spirit! - P3
mel: We're baaack!
kazuma: *Sigh* Do you ever run out of steam?
mel: We've made it back with another grueling quest under our belts. 
mel: I'm just happy, okay?! What's it to you?!
darkness: Yes, a punishing quest it was. A most brutal trial, rife with sweet, succulent pain!
kazuma: TMI, Darkness! TMI! 
kazuma: This quest WOULD have been a walk in the park, if not for a certain prankster!
kazuma: Now, Megumin! Broil 'em good!
megumin: I thought you'd never ask, Kazuma. Here goes! 
megumin: Explo—
megumin: !
megumin: AH-CHOO!
Giant Toad: Grrreeeeeeggghhh...
kazuma: Megumin, get your head in the game!
megumin: Zo... Zo...zowie.
megumin: ...
megumin: Ah-choo! 
megumin: Explooo—
megumin: ...
megumin: AH-CHOO!!!
mel: I'd hoped a well-timed sneeze would cause a more 
mel: potent Explosion. It seems I scattered a mite too much pepper.
kazuma: YOU?? AGAIN?!!
aqua: Eek! Kazuma, I could use some— 
aqua: HEYAAALP!
darkness: Use my body as a shield, Aqua!
darkness: YURRGH?!
megumin: The overgrown amphibian's headed this way! Halt! 
megumin: Halt, I say—
megumin: MMRRRGHMM?
Giant Toad: *Burp*
kazuma: GUYS, NOOOOOO...!
darkness: Getting covered in giant frog slime—a favorite, 
darkness: albeit nearly lethal pastime of mine. Thanks to Kazuma, I survived.
aqua: Speak for yourself. I despise getting drenched in slime! 
aqua: What do you have to say for yourself, Mel?!
mel: I'm so very sorry. But let's not dampen our spirits over this... 
mel: Here, wipe yourself off with this towel.
aqua: Oh. How considerate. Well, so long as you're sorry! Thank—
aqua: ... 
aqua: WAH-CHOO!
mel: Hahaha, I had all this pepper left over, so I coated the towel in it! One last hurrah!
kazuma: ...The little imp. 
kazuma: Mel, why do you do this to us?!
mel: I'm just trying to help. With everyone tuckered out, I figured a little prank would lift morale!
kazuma: Take a good look at the team. Do they seem happy?
kazuma: I've said it time and again, no? A true prank leaves everyone laughing, not just you.
kazuma: But look! 
kazuma: If you continue to walk this path of dark prankery, my dear disciple, then I fear our 
kazuma: questing days are done.
kazuma: Is this truly what you want?
kazuma: ...Er, Mel?
darkness: She wandered off. Guess your speech was too long.
kazuma: That incorrigible...
ynyn: Guys, you're finally back!
megumin: Yunyun? Don't tell me you've been waiting here this whole 
megumin: time, like a forlorn puppy... Again.
ynyn: N-No... Of course not! Not today, anyway. Say, is Mel not with you 
ynyn: today by any chance?
aqua: Mel? Kazuma was lecturing her so she ran away. 
ynyn: Rats. I have an urgent warning for her. 
kazuma: Urgent? As in...?
lia: Squall wants to seal her away in an eternal prison!
megumin: That most definitely qualifies as urgent news.
erica: According to Yunyun, Squall found out Mel played a prank on Dust and decided she needed to be locked up.
kazuma: Ah, from this morning...
cielo: Surely you see this is completely unjust!
kazuma: Squall did allude to something like this before... You really 
kazuma: think he'd go through with it, though?
darkness: Whatever the case, we must speak with Squall and Mel—in person. Then we can decide what to do.
kazuma: Right on. Let's start with Mel. Uh... Where'd she go?
erica: Well, if she's not with you, then maybe she's 
erica: there.
cielo: There? Where's there?
erica: The orphanage. I hear she stops by here and there. 
darkness: As in your orphanage, Erika?
kazuma: Has to be. Erika sometimes brings it up in between songs when performing. That must be how Mel heard about it.
ynyn: Let's hurry. If Squall gets to Mel first, it could be all over!
mel: Well? How do you like my performance?
Children: You're amazing!
Child A: One more song! We wanna dance too!
mel: You can have play with people...without pranking them? Now this is eye-opening.
mel: Pop quiz, everyone! Who would you rather be friends with—me or Axel Hearts?
Child B: Why not both?
Child C: But the Axel Hearts big sisters are cuter, 'specially Erika.
mel: I wasn't aware being cute was a factor in friendship...
mel: In that case, I'll become even cuter, while upping my song and dance game! Then can we be—
？？？: Friends? Don't count on it!
mel: Dust? What brings you here?
dust: You, obviously! Did you think I'd let you get away with your prank?
mel: So you're back for seconds, is it? What a peculiar man. You're kind of like Darkness, actually!
dust: Are you daft? I'm here to get even! When Dust gets dusted 
dust: he ALWAYS gets even.
mel: I think there's a misunderstanding! I didn't mean any harm. It was just my way of saying hello!
dust: Well ya did plenty harm, little lady! By searing my mouth and most of my digestive tract with that infernal cookie!
mel: O-Oh, oops. 
mel: Forgive me? Pretty please?
dust: So you realize the error of your ways, eh? Good.
dust: But I ain't just letting you off the hook. Not a chance. 
dust: I require compensation—lots. And lots! This is how things are done around here.
kazuma: No sign of her here.
erica: Strange. I was sure she'd be here.
Child A: Hey, look! It's Erika!
Child B: And Lia. Cielo too! Hey, will you perform for us, please?
lia: Maybe later, okay? First, we need to ask you something real important.
cielo: Did anyone see a pretty girl with turquoise hair here?
Child C: You mean Mel? She sang songs for us!
ynyn: R-Really? Where did she go?
Child A: Some scary hoodlum took her away. He kept saying stuff about "getting even."
Child B: And "compensation." Whatever that means.
darkness: Th-Th-Th-That man would dare put the squeeze on such a sweet girl? Dust...
darkness: You're a breed of scum all your own! Even worse than Kazuma!
kazuma: Hey! How did I get dragged into this?!
kazuma: But let's not 
kazuma: risk it, eh? Everyone—after Dust!
