Collecting on This Summer Beach! - P2
ナレーション: After being invited on a quest by Lia and Wiz, Kazuma and the others made their way to the beach...
kazuma_jersey: Wow, what a view! When you said we'd be hunting sharks I was a bit worried, but this is quite a popular spot!
kazuma_jersey: Just look at all the young people in swimsuits! I'm finally 
kazuma_jersey: experiencing it without a controller in my hand, too!
megumin_swimwear: Kazuma, you really shouldn't be ogling every girl you see.
wiz_swimwear: My apologies for the wait, Kazuma.
kazuma_jersey: Whoa!
kazuma_jersey: It's Wiz in all her glory! This is even better than I could have imagined!
lia_swimwear: Sorry, it took me longer than expected...
lia_swimwear: to get changed. Hey, Kazuma! What are you staring at?!
kazuma_jersey: What? Oh, um...
kazuma_jersey: Now that's a heaping helping of allure! Not quite as large as Wiz, but I should have expected this from a dancer!
kazuma_jersey: This is too much for someone only used to 2D! Pull yourself together, Kazuma! 
kazuma_jersey: You can't enjoy the view if you pass out!
megumin_swimwear: Where's your swimsuit, Kazuma? Aren't you going to change?
kazuma_jersey: We're here on a quest. I don't want to get caught with my guard down if something happens.
aqua_swimwear: Pft! *Snicker* Are you sure it isn't just because you're too afraid to get in the water?
kazuma_jersey: N-no! Of course not! And what about you? 
kazuma_jersey: Should you really be off playing when we're here to catch sharks?!
aqua_swimwear: Sure! The sharks are more likely to sneak up on us if they think we're all 
aqua_swimwear: having a good time!
kazuma_jersey: I know that's how it works in the movies, but...
lia_swimwear: So we wait for that moment, then launch our attack when they least expect it. It's a great plan.
wiz_swimwear: Um, Lia? If it isn't too much trouble, would you mind lending me your tanning oil?
wiz_swimwear: The sun is so strong I can already feel my skin tingling.
aqua_swimwear: That's a great idea. Let's forget about Kazuma and oil ourselves up good.
kazuma_jersey: Did you say oil?!
lia_swimwear: Yes, tanning oil. Why, is something wrong?
kazuma_jersey: Nope. Absolutely nothing. Please continue.
aqua_swimwear: I'll help you, Wiz. Hold still.
wiz_swimwear: Oh, thank you... Aqua? What are you doing? 
wiz_swimwear: That's starting to sting more than the sun...
aqua_swimwear: Really? Are you sure it's not just your imagination?
wiz_swimwear: The oil you're using is being purified! I'm going to—
wiz_swimwear: Yeeeeeek!
wiz_swimwear: 　　　　　　　　　　
megumin_swimwear: Aqua, cut it out! If you don't stop, Wiz is going to disappear completely.
aqua_swimwear: Sorry, I couldn't help myself. Seeing an undead lich having fun in a swimsuit just got to me, but I was only teasing.
wiz_swimwear: Would anyone else be willing to help me?
kazuma_jersey: Allow me.
megumin_swimwear: Kazuma, your mind is in the gutter again, isn't it?
kazuma_jersey: Not at all.
megumin_swimwear: Care to explain those strange motions with your hands, then?
kazuma_jersey: I am merely warming up my fingers so as not to cause any harm to your silky smooth skin.
lia_swimwear: Kazuma, I don't think that's how it works...
kazuma_jersey: There's no time to waste! Let's begin! Quickly now, before the sun causes lasting damage!
ナレーション: No one took Kazuma up on his offer. He did, however, begin to see the appeal of the beach as they took care of themselves...
