Making Summer Memories
erica_swimwear: This way, Cielo! 
erica_swimwear: I say we start here. All right?
cielo_swimwear: W-Wait a moment, Erika. Do we really have to go through with this?
erica_swimwear: Absolutely! Have you ever seen an ocean this blue before? 
erica_swimwear: Not taking a swim in these waters would be a sin.
cielo_swimwear: Y-Yeah, but why make it a race?
erica_swimwear: Odd. I pegged you for the competitive type. 
erica_swimwear: I thought you'd say "I'll thrash all comers!" or something like that. 
erica_swimwear: No?
cielo_swimwear: That's not who I am! Well, maybe when it comes to other sports. 
cielo_swimwear: But swimming? No way.
erica_swimwear: Cielo, don't tell me... 
erica_swimwear: You're not a very good swimmer?
cielo_swimwear: ...Pretty embarrassing, huh?
erica_swimwear: Not at all! You just have to practice!
cielo_swimwear: Practice, eh...?
erica_swimwear: Yep. You'd say the same for other activities, right? 
erica_swimwear: If you can't do something, practice and practice some more!
cielo_swimwear: Erika... 
cielo_swimwear: ...Actually, yeah. You're right! I'll give it a go!
erica_swimwear: Let's start with the basic flutter kick then. First, put your face in the water.
cielo_swimwear: Okay... Here I go... 
cielo_swimwear: Ack, I give up! I can't do it!
erica_swimwear: But you CAN, Cielo!
cielo_swimwear: Not being able to breathe scares me. Is there a way to swim without submerging my face? 
cielo_swimwear: Wait, what if I just walked?
cielo_swimwear: Before my right leg sinks, I'll move my weight to my left, and then back to my right! 
cielo_swimwear: Wow—I think I've invented water-walking!
erica_swimwear: I don't mean to rain on your parade, but that's definitely not gonna—
cielo_swimwear: Work? Sure it will! 
cielo_swimwear: Hi-yaaaaaaaaagh!
erica_swimwear: Wow. She actually walked. For about a half second, but still.
cielo_swimwear: *Pant pant* Water-walking's much harder than I thought...  
cielo_swimwear: Guess I just have to practice. And then practice some more!
erica_swimwear: I'm pretty sure working on your flutter kick would be much easier...
ナレーション: Still, Erika could not help being amazed at Cielo's incredible athletic ability.
