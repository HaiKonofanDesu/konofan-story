Komekko - P3
komekko: I don't wanna be stuck here alone. I wanna go to Axel.
arue: Sorry, little lady. I don't have time to take you today. I'm helping with my friend's shop at the flea market.
komekko: Aww... 
komekko: I wanted to wander town and get free food from everyone. 
arue: A child like you cannot travel alone. Stay put today 
arue: and I'll take you next time, okay?
komekko: IS it really out of the question...? 
komekko: Nope! Because I won't be alone! Hehe!
horst: *Sigh* We're here.
komekko: Thanks! I guess some kind of payment's in order. How about that bug I caught earlier?
horst: You're far too kind... A WHOLE bug, just for bringing you all this way?! 
horst: How cheap do you think I am?!
horst: *Sigh* 
horst: You're not supposed to be here. If you catch an earful from your mother, I'm not at fault, okay?
komekko: Don't worry. I'll be juuust fine. 
komekko: See ya around!
horst: Okay, see ya! 
horst: Or more like, HOPE TO SEE YOU NEVER EVER AGAIN!
komekko: Yep, see you soon!
horst: Argh! It's like talking to a brick wall!
？？？: Now that's a pair you don't see every day.
wiz: Hi, Vanir. I'm back. Thanks for covering for me 
wiz: while I...
komekko: *Munch* 
komekko: Now that's some tasty cake! Got any more?
banil: Hohoho. Oh, you greedy little goblin. And what if I said 
banil: we're clean out, hm?
komekko: Aw, boo.
banil: Mwahaha! 
banil: That's the spirit! There's nothing like a child's sweet, simple sorrows! How delectable.
wiz: What's Komekko doing here, Vanir? ...Oh dear! Has your 
wiz: appetite for dark emotions driven you to kidnapping?!
banil: Fool! 
banil: Such a young girl can subjugate demons! She piqued my interest, hence I brought her here.
komekko: I answered all his questions, and he gave me cake! Pretty good deal, huh?
wiz: A sweet reward for a sweet girl. 
wiz: But what brings you to Axel?
komekko: Well, I was home alone, but then I got hungry.
wiz: You got hungry. I see... 
wiz: I may have just the thing for that!
wiz: Might I suggest this magic potion? Just one bottle is enough to sate the most voracious of appetites.
komekko: If you say so! *Glug glug*
banil: That didn't take much coaxing. While I applaud her daring, 
banil: it was not the wisest of actions...
wiz: How do you feel, Komekko?
komekko: Whoa. My tummy feels full already! Amazing!
komekko: Now it feels heavy... So heavy I can't... 
komekko: m-move...
wiz: Oh my. Why is this happening?!
banil: Here in my hand I have a little something called a 
banil: manual. Read it, you pitiful excuse for a shopkeeper.
wiz: "Sate the heartiest of appetites with just one bottle."
banil: The FINE PRINT. 
wiz: "Consumption of contents may result in the temporary loss of locomotive abilities (with zero cosmetic changes)." 
wiz: WHAT?!
wiz: Komekko, are you okay? How do you feel?! Are you in any kind of pain?
komekko: I'm fine. Can't move though. Nngh...
wiz: Th-This is an emergency!
komekko: Hrrngh...! Mmmgh...! 
komekko: Zzzzzzzzz...
wiz: Komekko?! Vanir, I-I killed her!
banil: Her full belly made her drowsy. All is well. She'll be back to normal by the time she awakens.
wiz: Really? I'm so relieved.
banil: Is that so? Because your relief will be short-lived. I am well aware you bought that useless potion in bulk.
wiz: Y-You are? How?
banil: Because I possess eyes! The crates are piled high out front! 
banil: It's a good thing Komekko's asleep. 
banil: I wouldn't want to corrupt her youth. 
wiz: Y-Yeeeeeek!
komekko: ... 
komekko: Huh? 
komekko: I'm back...home.
arue: Are you awake, little lady?
komekko: Arue? You carried me all the way here?
arue: Sure did. I got word from Axel about what happened. But you were sleeping like a baby the whole way. 
arue: More importantly, a certain someone's parents are livid you ventured out on your own. 
komekko: Uh oh. 
komekko: You think I can get out of this, Arue? 
arue: Well I can't take the scolding in your place. Your parents are genuinely worried. I say face the music—and apologize.
komekko: Got it. 
komekko: Face the music today...but then more free meals tomorrow!
