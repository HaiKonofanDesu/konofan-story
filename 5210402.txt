Youthful School Life
dust_school: Hey, Lia! Nice timing!
lia_school: D-Dust? What are you wearing?
dust_school: It's called a school uniform. 
dust_school: I got it from Kazuma. 
dust_school: He's been making them 
dust_school: and 
dust_school: mumbling to himself 
dust_school: about harems and stuff.
dust_school: I was curious, so I asked him for one, and like the great friend he is, he sold me one. 
dust_school: Oh, one more thing. 
dust_school: I want you to have my second button.
lia_school: O-Oh, thanks...
dust_school: ...You accepted it? 
dust_school: All right, it's a deal then! 
dust_school: Now you've gotta lend me some money!
lia_school: W-Wait, what? 
lia_school: Why would I do that?
dust_school: Kazuma says school uniforms make you popular! And if you give someone the second button, 
dust_school: it means they'll do anything you ask!
dust_school: So let me borrow someâ€”
lia_school: No way.
dust_school: Huh?
lia_school: Not a chance. Besides, that's not what giving someone your second button means.
dust_school: N-No way. Seriously?
dust_school: Damn! And I paid good money for this thing! 
dust_school: Kazuma's trying to pull one over on me again!
lia_school: Ah, things are starting to make more sense. 
lia_school: How much money do you owe Kazuma now?
dust_school: Is this how he treats his friends?! I'm gonna beat the crap out of him until he gives me my money back!
lia_school: Hearing you talk like that in that outfit... Make sure the teachers don't catch you!
