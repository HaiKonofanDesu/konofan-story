God's Blessing on This New Year! (2022)
megumin_newyear: Kazuma! Kazuma! Can I open this slip of paper yet?
darkness_newyear: You called it a "fortune?" What a fun idea, predicting the year with a piece of paper!
aqua_newyear: What's this? "Vanir's 
aqua_newyear: All-Seeing Fortune"... 
aqua_newyear: How revolting. I'll burn it for you.
kazuma_newyear: Come on, they're pretty popular with the townsfolk. We should give them a try!
megumin_newyear: I'll go first... 
megumin_newyear: Oh! I got "Explosive Luck"!!!
megumin_newyear: Let's see... "Be careful how you use explosion magic, 
megumin_newyear: or you may give the person carrying 
megumin_newyear: you a backache..."
kazuma_newyear: Hey, it's talking about me!
darkness_newyear: Hm, I wonder what mine says... 
darkness_newyear: What?! "Masochist Luck"?!
darkness_newyear: "You mustn't try to intentionally get caught with Bind, or you may suffer a heavy blow..."
darkness_newyear: Looks like it's going to be a good year!
kazuma_newyear: Yup, 
kazuma_newyear: you haven't changed a bit.
aqua_newyear: Hmm, I suppose this might be fun. I wonder what my fortune is... 
aqua_newyear: Huh?! What is this "Penitent Luck"?!
megumin_newyear: Let me see... "It's inexcusable to slay devils! You must beg for forgiveness for your crimes!" 
megumin_newyear: "If you do, your impoverished life may find some relief from your terrible decision making! Mwahaha!" 
megumin_newyear: ...Or so it says.
aqua_newyear: Why that little—! This year, I'm gonna finally hunt down that masked fiend and purify his unholy—
darkness_newyear: T-Take it easy, Aqua... 
darkness_newyear: So, what did you get, Kazuma?
kazuma_newyear: Well as you know, I do have a crazy high luck stat. 
kazuma_newyear: Naturally, I got the best there is: "Fantastic Luck"!
megumin_newyear: "Health: You will die painfully, but will probably come back to life."
aqua_newyear: "Money: You have a knack for business, but those around you will drive you to destitution."
darkness_newyear: It says "Fantastic Luck," but those predictions doesn't sound very lucky to me...
kazuma_newyear: Ugh, I got my hopes up too soon! Is this a sign of things 
kazuma_newyear: to come? ...Actually, I guess it's just more of the same.
kazuma_newyear: I just wanted to live in peace this year... *Sob*
aqua_newyear: Hey, cheer up! Don't pay attention to that vile devil's nonsense. 
aqua_newyear: You've got a goddess with you!
megumin_newyear: Plus, I can blow away your bad luck with an Explosion!
darkness_newyear: Indeed! No matter what disaster may befall you, as a crusader, 
darkness_newyear: I will be your shield!
kazuma_newyear: Thanks, everyone! Okay then, let's give our
