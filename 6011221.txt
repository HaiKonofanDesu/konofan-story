God's Blessing on Dust's Birthday! (2021)
kazuma: Erm, you might wanna slow down there, Dust.
dust: Oh don't be such a prude. You promised that you'd party with me 'til mornin', didn't ya? 
dust: Another!
lean: Dust, haven't you drank enough? Try having some restraint, would you?
dust: Impossible. And just so you know, this was all Kazuma's idea to begin with. 
dust: Right buddy?
kazuma: Well, you said it was your birthday... I figured I could treat you, once in a blue moon.
aqua: Ahhh! Knockin' back bubbly on someone else's tab! Nothin' sweeter!
megumin: Me too! I wanna drink too!
darkness: Hey, Megumin, shall we order the most expensive steak on the menu? 
darkness: Might as well if Kazuma's paying, eh?
kazuma: And why, pray tell, do you think my generosity extends to you lot too?
dust: Don't be such a penny pincher, Kazuma. I know for a fact you made some serious coin yesterday.
kazuma: I can see it already. Every Eris I earned will disappear tonight.
dust: Then how about ending things early? That way, you and I can head to our next venue. 
dust: You know the one.
kazuma: How about no? I know you plan to make me foot the bill there, too.
dust: Ya got me. But your costs here will only climb, right?
dust: If we go to that special place, it'll be cheaper AND more fun. 
dust: Whaddya say?
kazuma: I guess that makes sense... 
kazuma: Wait, I refuse to be duped by you!
dust: That's too bad, 'cause I got this ticket for some super sultry birthday service. 
dust: Says here it includes one friend...
kazuma: Well, 
kazuma: we're calling it a night, gang! Everyone out. Chop-chop!
lean: Really? I mean, okay, but this is a little...abrupt?
aqua: No way! I am still so very far from full!
kazuma: Shut your trap! It's Dust's birthday! 
kazuma: And we've decided to engage in some good ol' fashioned male bonding.
dust: Kazuma...
kazuma: Let us depart.
dust: That's my man! Heheheh... 
dust: Now THIS will be a birthday to remember!
