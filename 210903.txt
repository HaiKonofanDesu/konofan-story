Cecily - P3
cecily: Aaah... My heart aches from a terrible sickness. I do not have much time left.
cecily: However! If you sign this contract, its mysterious power will heal me and bring you happiness! It's a win-win!
cecily: Isn't that wonderful? Just sign right here, and—
Bystander: No, thank you! I was worried when I saw you lying by the roadside... This is why nobody likes the Order of Axis.
cecily: Rats... Another one got away.
cecily: There aren't many people out and about today. I'll just have to talk to the ones I already know.
cecily: Hello, sir! Are you a model? You must be a model. Someone this good-looking can't be just any citizen!
dust: Huh? Good-looking? Are you talking about me?
cecily: Oh, it was you, Dust! You look quite handsome when I see you from a distance.
dust: Hehe, I've finally met a girl that appreciates my charm. 
dust: How about we go grab a bite to eat?
cecily: You'll pay my way, right Dust? I mean, you'll get the chance to drink with a beautiful priestess.
dust: You're an idiot is what you are. Later.
cecily: Ah, wait! Wait up! 
cecily: Fine, if that's how it has to be... Just sign this, and it'll be my treat.
dust: That's a contract, isn't it?
cecily: Forget about the fine print.
dust: You can't fool me like that! 
dust: This is why nobody likes the Order of Axis!
cecily: That's too bad. 
cecily: If you agreed to join, I could've given you some... 
cecily: Personalized service!
dust: Personalized service?
dust: A forbidden romance with a beautiful priestess! Any man would leap at the opportunity!
cecily: You see, one of our teachings is, "Be true to your desire." Holding yourself back is bad for you.
dust: Huh... Just for being a member of the Axis Order?! 
dust: Yes, I can picture the services now... Hehehe...
cecily: Oh! I know from that look that you're ready to join us! 
cecily: It'll be nice to have someone as handsome as you in the Order!
dust: You can count on me. Just let my handsome fingers sign—
？？？: Oh, it's you again. Still trying to grow your flock?
cecily: Ah!
dust: Huh?
cecily: What an absolute cutie!
megumin: No... 
megumin: Aaaaaah... 
megumin: C'mon, let go of me!
cecily: Aaaaaaaaah! 
cecily: You're adorable as ever, Megumin! 
cecily: Sure, I'll let go if you join the Order of Axis!
megumin: Hey, get serious for a minute, would you?! 
megumin: Somebody, give me a hand here!
？？？: Hm? That sounded like a young girl. Are you in danger?!
mitsurugi: Miss, please let go of her at once. She is clearly distraught.
cecily: Y-you're gorgeous! 
cecily: If you want me to let her go, then you must want me to grab you instead! Are you propositioning me?!
mitsurugi: N-no! I'm not propositioning anyone!
cecily: There's no need to be shy, darling. Just sign this marriage license and this Order of Axis application form...
cecily: It's destiny! You'll have found a wife and your faith today!\n
cecily: C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
mitsurugi: E-enough already!
megumin: *Sigh* It was my mistake for trying to interfere.
dust: She sure is acting differently with him. I guess her calling me handsome was just a dirty trick.
dust: That could've ended badly. I'd better get out of here. 
dust: It's not like I'm feeling down about it or anything!
megumin: Yeah, I should be getting home, too.
mitsurugi: Wait! Don't leave me alone with her!
cecily: Aww, hold up! Megumin! Mitsurugi! 
cecily: *Sigh* And there they go...
cecily: But at least I got my fill of cutie pies today. Not a bad day after all, I'd say.
cecily: Now, Dust... You were about to join— 
cecily: Huh? Where did he go?
cecily: Running off like that—how rude! 
cecily: Or maybe he was too embarrassed to stay?
cecily: "Think not about the departed." Okay, time to find some new blood! 
cecily: Hey! Excuse me, young man!
ナレーション: With her ever-positive attitude, Cecily cornered her next prospective convert. However, he also refused to sign...
