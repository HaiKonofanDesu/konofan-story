God's Blessing on Kazuma's Birthday! (2022)
kazuma: Hng... *Sniff sniff*
megumin: I'm back! 
megumin: Woah! Why are you crying like a little baby? What happened?
kazuma: Waaaaaahhh!!!
aqua: Megumin, would you come here for a second?
darkness: The reason Kazuma is so upset is that today's his birthday. The trouble is, Aqua and I have been so busy that, well...
aqua: We completely forgot about it. And I'm sure he knows, considering how late in the day it is. We should have thrown a party by now.
megumin: I see. So that's why he broke down.
kazuma: Wahaha... My birthday... Waaahhh...
megumin: That's understandable. 
megumin: Listen. I have an idea, but I'll need your help.
aqua: Kaaazuuumaaa! I'm so sorry we're late!\n
aqua: We brought you a birthday present!
kazuma: ...
kazuma: Aqua!
aqua: I found this really pretty stone in the forest the other day.\n
aqua: It made me think of you, so I thought you should have it.
megumin: And I got you one of the Crimson Demon Clan's legendary eyepatches!\n
megumin: Now we can be eyepatch twinsies!
darkness: H-Here... This is a coupon for one favor from me. 
darkness: I'll do whatever you want, so don't feel like you have to hold back.
kazuma: ...
aqua: Okay, everybody. On three! One, two...
Aqua, Megumin ＆ Darkness: Happy birthday!
kazuma: You really did forget my birthday, didn't you?! This is awful! 
kazuma: Waaaaaahhh!!!
megumin: No! No, of course we didn't! 
megumin: It's just, um, taking longer than we expected to get your real present.
aqua: That's right! We just wanted to do something in the meantime.\n
aqua: I mean, you seemed so down! Now come on, let's crack open my best bubbly!
darkness: Yeah, let's celebrate. Stop crying and join us, Kazuma!
kazuma: Do you guys... 
kazuma: Do you really mean it? 
kazuma: Oh, I can't wait! I hope it's a really good present!
Aqua, Megumin ＆ Darkness: Happy birthday, Kazuma!
