lean_china: Ta-da! 
mitsurugi_china: You look fantastic, Rin. 
lean_china: You too. 
lean_china: Isn't wearing a new outfit so fun? 
lean_china: Maybe I should go all out and become a melee-type! 
lean_china: Don't hold me to that though... 
mitsurugi_china: Lady Aqua is truly magnificent! To be the recipient of an amazing outfit made by her own hands... 
mitsurugi_china: I'm truly blessed on this day! 
lean_china: And it was so nice of her to give them to us for free! 
mitsurugi_china: Huh? Free?
lean_china: "No payment needed! I just followed my artistic instincts," 
lean_china: she said. She wouldn't accept a single Eris from me. 
mitsurugi_china: Oh... 
lean_china: Huh?  
lean_china: Did she charge you, Mitsurugi? 
mitsurugi_china: Curse you, 
mitsurugi_china: Kazuma Satou! 
lean_china: Huh?! What's Kazuma got to do with this? 
mitsurugi_china: He's the one who sold this to me! 
mitsurugi_china: He told me it was my chance to own an outfit made by Lady Aqua for "only 30,000 Eris".
lean_china: I see. 
lean_china: Aqua gave him the outfit for free, and he turned around sold it to you. How very Kazuma. 
mitsurugi_china: He's unbelievable! 
mitsurugi_china: And what truly upsets me the most is the price tag! 
mitsurugi_china: This outfit was handcrafted by the goddess herself! 
mitsurugi_china: It is worth at least a million Eris! 
lean_china: That's what's upsetting you?! 
mitsurugi_china: Yes! I can't take this affront any longer! I won't let this one go, 
mitsurugi_china: Kazuma Satoooooou! 
lean_china: S-See you later...
