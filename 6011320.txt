God's Blessing on Rin's Birthday! (2022)
kazuma: What's up, Dust? It's rare to see you up so early.
dust: Actually, I'm here to ask a favor. Tonight I'm throwing a birthday party for Rin...
aqua: Are you asking for money so you can get her a present?
dust: Yeah, so will you lend me some?
kazuma: Nope.
dust: That was fast. Well, she probably wouldn't be happy with a present I bought with borrowed cash anyway.
dust: She's always helping me out, so I was trying to think of a gift and couldn't come up with anything.
megumin: So you want us to give you some ideas?
dust: Exactly! I knew you'd understand.
darkness: That's sweet of you. We'd be happy to help.
aqua: After all, it is a special day.
Everyone: Happy birthday, Rin!
lean: Thank you, everyone... I didn't expect you all to come 
lean: here and celebrate with me.
dust: Hey, don't forget about me! I even brought you a present and everything!
lean: A present? From you?
aqua: Yeah, Dust came to us early this morning 
aqua: and asked us to help pick out a gift for you, 
aqua: so we all pitched in.
dust: Whoa! You don't need to tell her that!
lean: Hmm... So the same Dust that constantly begs me for money actually bought me a present.
lean: What's the catch?
dust: There's no catch! Here ya go.
dust: It's nothing fancy, but you're always looking out for me, so...
lean: A hairpin?
dust: Well, your hair is so long... I thought this would help you keep it out of the way.
lean: That's so incredibly thoughtful of you. Hmm... 
lean: There has to be a catch...
dust: I told you, there's no catch!
dust: Sheesh.
lean: Hehe... Thank you.
aqua: Okay, everyone...
aqua: Happy birthday, Rin!
Everyone: Cheers!
