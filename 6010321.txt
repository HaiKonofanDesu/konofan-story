God's Blessing on Darkness's Birthday! (2021)
aqua: Hey, Darkness, I baked you a birthday cake! 
aqua: Well, what do you think?
darkness: You made this for me? It's splendid. 
darkness: Thank you. It's so beautiful, I almost don't want to eat it.
aqua: Yeah, I definitely pulled out all the stops this time. It's an absolute masterpiece! 
aqua: ...Which is exactly why you'd better eat it. 
aqua: It tastes as good as it looks—promise!
darkness: Hehe... Then I can't wait to dig in.
megumin: And this is a little something from us.
darkness: Can this be?
darkness: Vanir's mask?! But how?
kazuma: Close. It's a replica. 
kazuma: Remember that time Vanir took over your body?
kazuma: And your attacks...
kazuma: actually landed? 
kazuma: You were practically over the moon. So I spoke with Vanir and... Ta-da!
darkness_mask: Look! I'm hitting monsters for a change, and not thin air!
darkness_mask: Kazuma, Megumin, Aqua—thank you. At long last, I can provide the team with some offensive support. 
darkness_mask: Watch me go!
megumin: Darkness is happy. Mission accomplished.
aqua: Yes...
aqua: And though I'd rather not fraternize with demons, look at her. 
aqua: She's in a state of bliss.
megumin: Kazuma, I noticed you didn't tell her that the mask's effects are short-lived. 
megumin: Very short-lived, in fact.
aqua: Furthermore, the materials that went into making it are super rare. Making another one will be almost impossible. 
kazuma: Vanir did mention he acquired the materials by pure chance.
kazuma: No matter. We shouldn't rely on such shortcuts, anyway. 
kazuma: We should follow Darkness's example, and face challenges head on.
megumin: Heh, you may have a point there.
aqua: Darkness! Don't run off on your own—it's dangerous! 
aqua: Oh, and one more thing...
Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
