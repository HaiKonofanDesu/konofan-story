God's Blessing on This Wonderful Work of Art! - P2
ナレーション: One peaceful afternoon, Kazuma was on his own as he sat at the bar...
kazuma: A man with brooding eyes sits alone at the bar...
Adventurer A: Hey, did you hear the news? Kazuma's party defeated another one of the Devil King's generals.
Adventurer B: They look like a bunch of losers, but they do good work.
kazuma: People gaze at me with envy as they sing my praises. The ladies find my calm and cool demeanor irresistible!
Waitress: Um, excuse me, sir? Your order?
kazuma: I'll take it straight. And your best smoked meat.
kazuma: Nice! That's how a cool, confident guy talks!
Waitress: Uh... A straight what?
kazuma: Huh?
Waitress: And we have all kinds of smoked meat.
kazuma: Bwah?! Strong! Something strong! 
kazuma: As for the smoked meat, I'll take your finest jerky. Yeah, jerky!
Waitress: Can you be more specific? Also, our jerky is dried, not smoked. I do recommend our smoked boar, though.
kazuma: Th-then I'll have that! And whatever else you suggest!
Waitress: I'll be right back. *Snicker*
Adventurer A: Did you see him sit up and try to act all cool?
Adventurer B: I've never seen him drink anything but bubbly.
kazuma: Damn these guys! They should mind their own business!
？？？: A-are you...Kazuma Satou?
kazuma: Hm? Do I know you?
？？？: I just recently became an adventurer, but I've heard a lot about you! We're almost the same age, and you've taken down generals!
？？？: This is so exciting. Can I shake your hand?
kazuma: Wait, does this mean that she's a fan of mine?
kazuma: Hmph... You've got a good eye. What's your name?
lan: My name is Ran!
kazuma: Ran, eh? That's a nice name.
lan: I never thought I'd shake hands with the great Kazuma! This is wild! What do I do?!
Waitress: Sorry for the wait. Here's the drink you ordered.
kazuma: Ah, crap. I've only ever had bubbly before. I'm not used to drinking this stuff... I can't afford to look like a fool.
kazuma: Ran, as a veteran adventurer, I bought this drink for you. 
kazuma: You need to drink this if you wanna be like me.
lan: Th-thank you! I'll do my best!
lan: *Glug glug* 
lan: Whew.
kazuma: She downed it like it was nothing. That was close.
？？？: Mr. Satou?
kazuma: Y-yeah? Can I help you? Let me guess, you want to 
kazuma: shake my hand too?
luna: Don't be silly. Of course not, Mr. Satou.
luna: We have a job that only a seasoned adventurer like you can pull off, Kazuma.
luna: You wouldn't turn this down in front of one of your fans, would you?
kazuma: Hahaha! I'll accept, of course!
luna: Oh, I'm so relieved. You see, a rather large problem has presented itself recently.
kazuma: Y-you want me to slay a golem?!
kazuma: A golem? We are talking about the same thing, right? The ones that are really hard to hurt?
luna: Yep, that's the one. I hear that it's hard as a rock 
luna: and tremendously strong, too.
kazuma: What should I do? I don't want to risk my neck, but...
lan: Amazing! This is a chance to show your skills, Kazuma!
kazuma: Huh?
lan: The guild lady even asked for you personally! I hope that she can depend on me the same way someday!
kazuma: Y-yeah, 
kazuma: I guess so.
luna: This is no ordinary quest, either. It's a high-level quest, so be ready for anything.
lan: Rushing recklessly into a dangerous adventure... I think I'm going to faint!
kazuma: I was going to decline, but when one of my fans looks at me like that... 
kazuma: I really don't have a choice!
kazuma: Understood.
luna: All right, then...
kazuma: Okay. It's time...to slay a golem!
lan: Yay! You're not only cool, you've also got a heart of gold! I'll be your biggest fan, Kazuma!
kazuma: Hehe... You be a good girl until I get back, okay?
ナレーション: And so, Kazuma took on the duty of slaying the golem...
