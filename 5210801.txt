Fireworks at the Yukata Festival
ナレーション: In the Crimson Demon Village, Komekko stopped by the goldfish game, determined to go home with a catch...
komekko_yukata: Hmm...
ynyn_yukata: I've never seen her with such an intense expression on her face... 
ynyn_yukata: Komekko, it's only a game. You know, for fun?
komekko_yukata: That's where you're wrong. This isn't about fun. This is about food for my family. Our very survival.
ynyn_yukata: What?
komekko_yukata: Each catch... 
komekko_yukata: goes straight into my store 
komekko_yukata: of emergency rations!
ynyn_yukata: Amazing. Her hands are moving faster than the eye can follow!
Shopkeeper: Wahaha! You're quite the fisher, lass!
komekko_yukata: And I'm just getting started. Haaah!
ynyn_yukata: She's on a roll...
Shopkeeper: S-She's bagged ten now... Say, kid, I think that's enou—
komekko_yukata: Hwah! Hoo! 
komekko_yukata: Hyaaah!
Shopkeeper: Stop! Please, I beg you! If you take any more fish I'll be going home broke!
komekko_yukata: Aw. The scoop broke.
Shopkeeper: Thank the goddess... Thanks for stopping by, you two. And please—don't ever come back!
ynyn_yukata: Does Komekko really plan on eating those? 
ynyn_yukata: Come to think of it, I did hear she forages for crayfish. Cicadas too...
ynyn_yukata: Say, if you're not going to keep those fish as pets, why not release them in the village pond?
komekko_yukata: But I'm hungry.
ynyn_yukata: Then by all means, let me treat you. 
ynyn_yukata: Today you can eat anything and everything you want! How's that, hmm?
komekko_yukata: Really? Anything?
ynyn_yukata: Would I lie to you? Go for it.
komekko_yukata: Okay then. I'll free the fish.
ynyn_yukata: Even when famished, she listened to reason. Komekko's got a good heart.
komekko_yukata: Hehehe. 
komekko_yukata: Grownups are so gullible.
ナレーション: Yunyun soon emptied her wallet down to the last Eris.
