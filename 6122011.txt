God's Blessing on This New Year! (2022) 
iris_newyear: We wish you... 
Everyone: A Happy New Year! 
wiz_newyear: Since we're dressed for the occasion, perhaps we could hear more about your world's New Year's traditions, Kazuma? 
kazuma_newyear: After the standard holiday greetings, we usually go to a temple and draw slips of paper with the year's fortune on them. 
iris_newyear: I understand the concept of drawing fortunes, 
iris_newyear: but why must it be at a temple? 
kazuma_newyear: To pray for yet another year free of harm or mishaps. 
iris_newyear: That sounds lovely! 
megumin_newyear: Let's go then! 
megumin_newyear: Yunyun, hold down the fort for us, will you? 
ynyn_newyear: Huh?! B-But I want to go too! 
megumin_newyear: Oh, I was only joking. Don't forget anything when we leave, okay? 
darkness_newyear: Hehe, dressing up on New Year's day and going out as a group—what fun. 
aqua_newyear: It WOULD be fun if not for some masked degenerate! 
banil_newyear: Hmph. It's said that New Year's is a day for greeting the gods. 
banil_newyear: Since you're here doing nothing of apparent value, 
banil_newyear: I assume your godly status has finally been revoked? 
aqua_newyear: You wanna go? Sacred Exor— 
kazuma_newyear: Stop! 
kazuma_newyear: No fighting on New Year's, got it? 
aqua_newyear: But, but, this horrid demon is... 
kazuma_newyear: Expensive bubbly. Exquisite cuisine. New Year's. 
aqua_newyear: Okay gang, the faster we leave, the faster we can return! 
aqua_newyear: New Year's is the time for love and gratitude! 
kazuma_newyear: So simple. So self-serving. 
iris_newyear: Aqua's always brimming with cheer. 
iris_newyear: I can't wait for my very first New Year's with everyone! 
megumin_newyear: Kazuma, you'll make mochi soup for New Year's, right? Right? 
darkness_newyear: It is one of Kazuma's best dishes. 
darkness_newyear: Princess, what say you to flying kites after eating? 
darkness_newyear: It's another New Year's must. 
iris_newyear: By all means, Lalatina. I'm excited already. 
iris_newyear: And Kazuma, please allow me to say it once more—
iris_newyear: Happy New Year. 
kazuma_newyear: Right back at ya. Happy New Year!
