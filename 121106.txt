daniel_troll: We'll retreat for now, but don't think this is the 
daniel_troll: last you've seen of us! I will never give you up, Lia!
charlie_troll: What about being reinstated in the Devil King's army? Are you really more focused on Lia...?
clair: H-Hold it right there!
darkness: Tch... They're too quick.
clair: We have to end this! After them!
kazuma: No...we've fought enough for today.
clair: But—
kazuma: Hey, I'm the producer, you know. And the most important thing for dancers to worry about is their fans.
erica_stage: Kazuma...
cielo_stage: Kazuma's right. Our fans should come first.
lia_stage: Besides, today's show was supposed to be special. 
lia_stage: Mel, let's see this through to the end!
mel_stage: Right! I'm with you!
clair: ...
lia_stage: Thanks for coming out tonight! We love all of you!
erica_stage: A rather repulsive pair showed up to ruin the night, 
erica_stage: but thanks for your support we drove them off!
Fans: YEEEAAAHHH!!!
cielo_stage: Mel, you should say something too.
mel_stage: Um, um... 
mel_stage: I have a confession to make. It's my fault the show was delayed tonight... 
mel_stage: Please forgive me...
Fan A: Everyone makes mistakes! Don't worry about it!
Fan B: Your singing was amazing! Promise that you'll come back again!
mel_stage: You're all so kind...
Axel Hearts, Mel: Thank you all so much for coming!
cielo_stage: Phew... We made it through, somehow.
kazuma: You've still got to say goodbye, 
kazuma: but you did a great job out there tonight.
erica_stage: Mel's singing was beautiful! I hope we can do that again.
mel_stage: Practice was intense, 
mel_stage: but I'd love to as well.
lia_stage: I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunities from now on!
iris_stealth: That was a fantastic show, everyone! I'm so excited 
iris_stealth: that I doubt I'll be able to sleep much tonight!
rain: Yes, I had a wonderful time as well. Thank you very much.
lia_stage: Please, we're not worthy of such praise.
mel_stage: Kazuma! Did you enjoy the show today? 
mel_stage: Did it make you smile?
kazuma: Yeah, I had a blast. You did great.
mel_stage: Oh, I'm so glad. This was my way of 
mel_stage: expressing my gratitude toward you, Kazuma.
mel_stage: The 
mel_stage: reason I joined tonight's show was to thank you for everything you do for me.
mel_stage: Lia, Cielo, Erika. Thank you so much for helping me. 
mel_stage: And all the rest of you, too. Thank you for being so kind.
mel_stage: I can't thank you enough for bringing me to Axel and 
mel_stage: accepting me as a resident here.
kazuma: What do you think, Claire? The dangerous lightning spirit is pouring her heart out over here.
clair: Hmph... 
clair: You just had to bring me into this, huh?
clair: Everything worked out in the end, but you're still the reason for all this trouble.
mel_stage: Y-Yes... 
mel_stage: I have no excuses.
clair: However, it is also true that Lady Iris thoroughly enjoyed herself tonight. 
clair: And the other attendees were pleased as well. 
clair: And as much as I hate to admit it, I had fun too.
iris_stealth: Claire, does that mean?!
clair: "The lightning spirit Mel has been accepted as a resident of Axel without incident." 
clair: That will be my report to the capital.
mel_stage: Claire... Thank you!
iris_stealth: Thank you, Claire! I love you!
clair: L-L-L-Love?! 
clair: Ahhhhhh!
rain: Oh, dear. Claire, you're bright red.
darkness: Hehe, it's not often we get to see this side of Miss Claire.
aqua: Come on! We got a nice reward for our quest, so let's get our celebration party started!
Fans: Encore! Encore! We want more Axel Hearts and Mel!
megumin: Sounds like the fans want to celebrate too.
kazuma: As dancers, you can't very well ignore 
kazuma: such a heartfelt plea, can you?
mel_stage: What do you think?
lia_stage: The crowd's calling! Let's go back on stage!
erica_stage: That's the spirit! 
erica_stage: If we're going back out there, I know exactly which song to sing.
cielo_stage: Yeah! After all, we did practice all day! 
cielo_stage: You up for it, Mel?
mel_stage: Hehe, do you even need to ask? 
mel_stage: Thank you for your support, everyone!
kazuma: Looks like this crazy group of misfits has a new member... 
kazuma: I have a feeling her pranks aren't going to end anytime soon, but... 
kazuma: Maybe that won't be so bad.
erica_stage: Since you asked for it, we've decided to share our 
erica_stage: brand new song! Are you ready?!
lia_stage: Thank Mel for inspiring this one! Without further ado!
Axel Hearts, Mel: "Smile Surprise"!
