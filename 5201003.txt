Mighty Martial Arts Girls
ナレーション: Erika and Cecily were hard at work practicing the martial arts techniques they learned from Aqua...
cecily_china: All right, Erika. Take a slow, deep breath.
erica_china: Haaaaaah... Cecily, is this really going to help me 
erica_china: become even cuter than I already am?
cecily_china: Of course! Lady Aqua's wisdom never fails! Can't you feel the difference from wearing these outfits?
erica_china: You're right. These are pretty cute.
cecily_china: Of course I'm right! Erika, do you know of God Requiem?
erica_china: Sure. That's Aqua's special attack, isn't it?
cecily_china: Just between us, I've heard rumors that the origin of that attack is rooted in Aqua's mastery of the martial arts.
erica_china: R-Really?!
cecily_china: And we've been hearing all sorts of wonderful things from 
cecily_china: other Axis devotees! I can share a few!
cecily_china: "I had my doubts, but I lost over ten kilos in the first 
cecily_china: month alone!"
erica_china: Ten kilos?! That's better than dieting!
cecily_china: "I met a great guy at my class. We've been together ever since!"
erica_china: Oh, that's so romantic.
cecily_china: "He's now my husband, and our eleventh child is due next year!"
erica_china: E-Eleven kids?!
cecily_china: "I was in so much debt that I lost my house. But after learning martial arts, 
cecily_china: I struck it rich! I'm a millionaire now!"
erica_china: I don't think martial arts had anything to do with that...
cecily_china: You'd be surprised! Devoting yourself to martial arts hones the spirit,
cecily_china: which has brought incredible fortune to those who stick with our classes!
cecily_china: Erika, I'm sure our lessons will transform you into a woman as beautiful as our goddess, Aqua!
erica_china: As beautiful as a goddess?! Oh, that'd be a dream come true! 
erica_china: Martial arts just gets better and better!
cecily_china: If I play my cards right, this could prove incredibly useful...
cecily_china: But Erika, hard work alone is not enough. The true effects of our 
cecily_china: martial arts are only available to Axis followers!
cecily_china: Axis adherents progress ten times as quickly! And if 
cecily_china: you recruit others, the rate increases a hundred times more!
erica_china: A hundred times more? 
erica_china: This suddenly sounds rather suspicious...
cecily_china: Don't you want to be even cuter than you currently are?
erica_china: You're right! I'll do whatever it takes!
cecily_china: Wonderful! You can join right away! And your cuteness will 
cecily_china: increase as soon as you recruit ten new members!
erica_china: I'll do my best!
cecily_china: Don't forget! The more you recruit, 
cecily_china: the cuter you'll get!
erica_china: Okay! 
erica_china: Hooraaaaaay!
ナレーション: Erika fervently canvassed for new recruits, but was persuaded to stop when Lia and Cielo heard what Cecily had told her.
