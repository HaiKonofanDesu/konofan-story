Megumin - P2
ナレーション: One day, Megumin returned to the Crimson Demon Village along with Yunyun and Chomusuke.
arue: Welcome back, Megumin. What brings you here so suddenly?
megumin: It's good to see you. I really missed this village, so it's nice to be back.
chomu: Meooow.
arue: Well? What kind of trouble did you get yourself into now?
ynyn: Her explosion magic has left craters all around Axel, so she's been banned from using magic for a while.
megumin: So I figured I'd practice my explosion magic here until things cool down and I can return to Axel.
arue: Ahh. I figured it'd be something along those lines... You never change, Megumin.
megumin: I'm a hard worker. I'll have this village surrounded by craters in just a few days!
ynyn: You mustn't! As the daughter of our clan's chieftain, I can't let you do that!
komekko: Ah! Welcome home, Sis!
megumin: Oh, Komekko! You came to welcome me back, I see. 
megumin: How has everyone been doing while I've been gone?
komekko: Pretty good! Hey, I'm hungry, Sis.
megumin: Gotcha. Today, you can eat as much as you want.
komekko: Hooray! Thanks, Sis! *Chomp*
chomu: Reeeyooow!
megumin: Hey, I told you before! Chomusuke isn't food!
komekko: But I'm so hungry...
ynyn: Haven't you been eating?
komekko: Yesterday, I ate some bugs I caught.
ynyn: Huh?
komekko: With some salt.
arue: Wow... You're quite the survivalist, aren't you?
megumin: Yunyun! Bring the souvenirs!
ynyn: Here you go, Komekko!
komekko: I-it's...!
megumin: It's smoke lizard meat and fresh onions. We're making hamburgers for dinner tonight!
komekko: Hamburgers?! I haven't had meat in forever!
megumin: Be sure to thank Yunyun. She's the one who paid for it.
komekko: Thanks, Yunyun!
ynyn: You don't need to thank me. 
ynyn: But I wouldn't mind if we ate togeth—
Megumin ＆ Komekko: Well, see ya!
ynyn: Ah...
arue: That's what you get for saying you didn't need any thanks. You should've just asked to join them.
ynyn: Aww... I was hoping to have dinner with my friends.
ナレーション: Two empty dishes sit on a small table...
chomu: Meow!
megumin: How'd you like it, Chomusuke? I made sure yours didn't have any onions in it.
komekko: Ugh... I think I ate too much.
megumin: Komekko, if you sleep right after eating, you're gonna turn into a real-life cow.
komekko: I know... But I'm sleepy...
megumin: Okay, fine... I'll set up the beds.
komekko: Um, Sis?
megumin: What is it, Komekko?
komekko: I've been a really good girl, so...please come home more often, okay?
megumin: Komekko... She must be so lonely without me.
megumin: Okay. I promise I'll come back again soon.
komekko: Hooray! I'm so happy! 
komekko: G'night, Sis...
megumin: Sleep tight, Komekko.
chomu: Meow.
komekko: Chomusuke... You're tomorrow's breakfast.
chomu: Meow?!
megumin: I've already got something in mind for breakfast tomorrow. So don't eat Chomusuke, okay?
ナレーション: The following morning, Chomusuke narrowly escaped being eaten by a hungry Komekko.
