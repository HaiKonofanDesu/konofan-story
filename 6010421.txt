God's Blessing on Chris's Birthday! (2022)
Aqua, Darkness, Melissa: Happy birthday, Chris!
chris: Thanks for celebrating my big day, everyone. 
chris: Being the center of attention does make me a tad self-conscious, though.
melissa: No need to apologize. You're the birthday girl. Be proud. 
melissa: After all, you're being graced with MY presence.
chris: You're right. 
chris: Thanks for the pep talk, Melissa.
darkness: Plus with the goddess Eris's natal festivities so close, it's best we celebrate while we can.
aqua: On that note...CAKE! (Courtesy of Kazuma.) 
aqua: Make sure to get all the candles in one breath, eh?
chris: A-
chris: All of them? 
chris: Aren't there a few too many for that!?
aqua: Better than too few! I piled 'em on, just for you!
darkness: I don't think Aqua knows that the candles correspond with age.
melissa: Don't forget to make a birthday wish.
chris: Good point... Wonder what I should wish for... 
chris: I'd like a perfect, peaceful day...
chris: where 
chris: my underwear isn't pilfered!
aqua: Sounds good! Now make your wish and blow!
chris: Okay then. Here it goes... 
chris: Phwooo
chris: ooooooooo!
melissa: Oops. You missed one.
chris: Aw...
aqua: Heh. I expected this would happen. 
aqua: This, my friends, is what Kazuma calls an event flag!
darkness: Chris... Your underpants are as good as gone now. 
darkness: What luck!
chris: Luck?! This is terrible! 
chris: Oh, I can only imagine what tragedies await me...
melissa: Uh, last time I checked, this is a party. 
melissa: So relax and enjoy yourself, hm?
aqua: Agreed. It's not like worrying will solve anything! 
aqua: Kazuma gets into messes like this all the time, and he's fine.
chris: ...True. 
chris: No worrying today! I feel better already!
chris: Everyone, thank you for coming, and for the cake! I'm so happy!
ナレーション: And so, Chris extinguished the final candle, going on to savor a very special birthday with the gang...
