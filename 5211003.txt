Dreamy Pajama Night 
dust_pajama: I've got an early morning. I need to get to bed. 
melissa_pajama: What? Already? 
melissa_pajama: With a beautiful woman at your bedside? 
dust_pajama: I said not to do that! 
dust_pajama: I hate when women get too needy. 
melissa_pajama: You're so cold. 
melissa_pajama: But that's what makes a man irresistible. 
melissa_pajama: Don't you think so, Dust?
dust_pajama: Dude, I'm exhausted. I just wanna sleep. 
melissa_pajama: How about we exhaust you a little more first? 
melissa_pajama: Hehe. The night is long. 
melissa_pajama: C'mon, Dust. Pretty please? 
dust_pajama: Fine, if you insist! 
dust_pajama: Hehehe... 
melissa: Ugh, this idiot! Wake up! 
melissa: I just wanted him here so people would leave me alone. Did he drink too much? 
dust: Oh, so voluptuous... 
melissa: I don't think I want to know what he's dreaming about... 
melissa: Ah, whatever! I'll have another drink. 
melissa: Excuse me! One each of your most expensive dish and drink, please! 
melissa: Put it on his tab.
dust: Heh... Hehehe... 
ナレーション: All the color drained from Dust's blushing face when he woke up from his pleasant dream and beheld his bill.
