A Little Luck for This New Year! - P6 
Money Cat: Meowney... 
kazuma_newyear: It's too weak to get away. 
kazuma_newyear: Now's our chance! 
darkness_newyear: Leave it to me! 
megumin_newyear: Riches, I beckon thee! 
Money Cat: Meowney, moewney... 
banil_newyear: Aaand got it! 
banil_newyear: There, there. Nothing to be afraid of. 
iris_newyear: Oh! 
Money Cat: Meowney... 
wiz_newyear: You did it, Vanir! 
aqua_newyear: Hold up! Were you hiding until we did all the work? 
aqua_newyear: Atone for your cowardice and hand it over! 
banil_newyear: Spare me the lecture. 
banil_newyear: All is fair in love, war, and cat-catching. 
aqua_newyear: Grrr! 
aqua_newyear: Then I propose a trade! The money cat for Chomusuke! 
megumin_newyear: Chomusuke is my familiar, not a trade good! 
aqua_newyear: But we were so cloooose! We basically had it! 
banil_newyear: Hm? 
wiz_newyear: What's happening? Vanir, your body! 
iris_newyear: It's glowing gold! 
banil_newyear: It appears that I have received the money cat's blessing. 
banil_newyear: With this, our shop's financial future is more than secure! 
wiz_newyear: Good going, Vanir! 
Money Cat: Meowneeey! 
iris_newyear: And thank you very much, dear cat! Farewell! 
wiz_newyear: Sorry for that, everyone. 
wiz_newyear: Once business picks up, I'll be sure to find a way to thank you. 
kazuma_newyear: No worries. I'm looking forward to it. 
banil_newyear: Come one, come all! 
banil_newyear: Our New Year's sale is still going strong! 
iris_newyear: Wow! Do you see all these customers? 
kazuma_newyear: Yeah, looks like it's going well. That money cat was the real deal. 
banil_newyear: Well is an understatement. 
banil_newyear: Business hasn't slowed for days! 
aqua_newyear: Try not to choke on that attitude, demon. 
banil_newyear: Hehehe. Is envy becoming of such a holy being as yourself? 
banil_newyear: If you're short on money, I could hire you part-time. 
aqua_newyear: Hard pass! 
aqua_newyear: I don't make deals with demons! 
kazuma_newyear: Didn't you try to trade Chomusuke to him for the money cat? 
darkness_newyear: Say, where's Wiz? I haven't seen her all day. 
banil_newyear: I haven't seen her since morning myself. 
banil_newyear: Always loafing around... This is what makes her a pitiful shopkeeper! 
ynyn_newyear: I wonder where she went. 
megumin_newyear: You're STILL working here, Yunyun? 
wiz_newyear: I'm back! 
iris_newyear: We were just wondering where you'd gone off to, Wiz. 
banil_newyear: Shopkeeper, say something next time you stop keeping the shop. 
wiz_newyear: Sorry. I had business in the Crimson Demon Village. 
megumin_newyear: The Crimson Demon Village? 
wiz_newyear: Hehe! I bought some surprise merchandise. 
banil_newyear: Hrm... 
wiz_newyear: Since we're selling so well, it only makes sense to stock up on another product to also sell well! 
banil_newyear: Uh-huh. And I'm assuming you used all our profits to buy these products? 
wiz_newyear: Of course! You have to spend money to make money. 
wiz_newyear: So the more I spend, the more we'll make! 
wiz_newyear: And now for the big product reveal! 
banil_newyear: VANIR'S DESTRUCTION RAY! 
wiz_newyear: Why?! 
wiz_newyear: You didn't even let me showcase the product... 
banil_newyear: We have a long and storied history together, Wiz. 
banil_newyear: Which is why I know whatever you bought was utterly imbecilic! 
ynyn_newyear: Um...so even with magic luck, store revenue is back to zero...or worse? 
banil_newyear: It seems that the real magic wasn't the cat, it was getting rid of this blasted lich! 
aqua_newyear: Pft! You did all this just to lose money anyway? Maybe we were the lucky ones! 
kazuma_newyear: Well, this is the most predictable turn of events ever. 
kazuma_newyear: But the important thing is that we had fun. 
iris_newyear: You're right. 
iris_newyear: If it's not too much to ask, Brother, please invite me next year too. 
ナレーション: And so, Iris's first New Year's holiday ended with her full of joy.
