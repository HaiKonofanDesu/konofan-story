Cherry Blossom Entrance Ceremony - P2
Bro-rilla: Graaah!
cielo: *Gasp* We're surrounded!
erica_school: ...And we were so close!
lia_school: Stand back, everyone! 
lia_school: Hraaagh!
Bro-rillas: Arghhh...
kazuma_school: Amazing! You took out the whole lot of 'em!
cielo: Thanks, Lia!
erica_school: Your outfit is cute, but you make it look cool too!
lia_school: Hehe... I'm glad we managed to defeat them all, 
lia_school: but I'm a little worried all that jumping around tore my outfit.
erica_school: Don't worry! It looks perfectly fine to me.
cecily: Now that that's taken care of, let's hurry back and start the entrance ceremony!
kazuma_school: Oh! 
kazuma_school: This year's entrance ceremony will now commence. 
kazuma_school: First, a word from your class representative!
lia_school: Yes, 
lia_school: sir!
lia_school: Thank you for organizing this lovely event for me today. 
lia_school: I promise to conduct myself in a way befitting a student!
erica_school: This feels a lot more serious than I was expecting...
cielo: Shh! You should be listening to Lia's speech.
kazuma_school: As students here, I hope you will endeavor to better yourselves and uphold the values of this school.
lia_school: Yes!
kazuma_school: Now for the presentation of your admission certificate.
cecily: That's my cue! I'll be giving you your certificate! 
cecily: Lia, congratulations on your admittance.
lia_school: You even made me a certificate? Thank you so— Hm? Wait. What's the blank space for?
cecily: That's for your name. Lia, if you would just sign here.
lia_school: I need to sign my admission certificate?
kazuma_school: That's an application form for the Order of Axis!
cecily: Oopsie! 
cecily: I must have grabbed the wrong form!
erica_school: You did that on purpose!
cecily: This is the church of Axis, you know! 
cecily: Holding a ceremony here is tantamount to a declaration of intent to join us!
kazuma_school: No, it is definitely not!
erica_school: That's right! Lia's got no interest in your crazy religion!
cecily: C-Crazy?! Hm... I see. 
cecily: It would appear you two cuties need some more convincing... 
cecily: *Pant pant*
cielo: C-Cecily! You're really starting to scare me! Erika, let's get out of here!
kazuma_school: Ah, man. I even rehearsed my principal voice... 
kazuma_school: I'm not sure if that counts as a successful ceremony or not.
lia_school: Hehe... It may have been a bit livelier than normal, 
lia_school: but it was something I won't soon forget. 
lia_school: Thanks, Kazuma.
ナレーション: Lia gave a warm smile as she looked fondly at all her friends...
