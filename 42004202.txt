Troll: Rrraaaaaawwwrrr!
darkness: *Pant pant* Is that all of them?
aqua: There's more over there! Hey, I'm getting pretty tired here!
megumin: Kazuma, can I use my explosion magic yet?
kazuma: It's too soon! The trolls are still scattered everywhere.\n
kazuma: You won't be able to get them all at once!
lia: We don't have a choice. I'll have to kill them all!
kazuma: She's really getting into this fight, but seeing her in this\n
kazuma: state is sure to hurt her popularity with the fans...
Fan A: Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Fan B: Wh-what is this?!
Fan C: I feel like I'm going to die...
kazuma: Oh no, the fans are getting hurt... 
kazuma: What?
lia: Hyah!
Fan A: Ooh! She finished another one off... She's so cool!
Fan B: I had no idea Lia was so strong! She's like a mighty goddess, descending upon the battlefield!
Fan C: Ah, I can't believe I got a shot of her looking so brave. I'm so happy I could die!
lia: Okay, who's next? Come and try me.
Troll: Ugh, urgh...
darkness: What spirit... The trolls are cowering before her!
lia: If you won't come to me, I'll come to you. 
lia: Hyaaah!
Troll: Arrrggghhhhhh!
Fan A: Woo! Lia, you're the best!
Fan B: You're the Goddess of the Battlefield!
Fan C: Goddess! Goddess! Goddess!
kazuma: I thought them seeing her fight would be bad for business, but I guess I was wrong.
darkness: Yeah, dancers need to be more than just a pretty face. This should give Lia's popularity a significant boost.
megumin: Hehehe, being cool is the key to success in this world! 
megumin: I'll have to teach Lia some Crimson Demon Clan poses!
lia: I don't fully understand, but everyone seems to be happy... I guess this means I should just try to be myself.
lia: Not sure about the whole "cute" thing... So I'll just keep doing my best.
lia: Bring it! Come and face Lia of Axel Hearts, if you dare!
ナレーション: The photo shoot was a great success. Lia and her fans all discovered something new that day...
