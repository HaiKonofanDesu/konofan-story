Blossoming New Year's Furisode
aqua_newyear: Our outfits fit perfectly! I really am amazing!
kazuma_newyear: I have to admit, it takes serious skills to be able to sew something as complicated as a furisode in a pinch.
aqua_newyear: What can I say? When you've got it, you've got it!
megumin_newyear: This isn't the easiest thing to move around in, 
megumin_newyear: but I like it. 
megumin_newyear: I feel it'll give my explosion magic a nice boost too.
darkness_newyear: Kazuma, do people where you're from wear clothing like this on a regular basis?
kazuma_newyear: No, furisode are for New Year's and special occasions.
kazuma_newyear: Shall we start over with the New Year's greeting, then? 
kazuma_newyear: Just like I taught you earlier. Ready?
Everyone: Happy New Year!
aqua_newyear: All right, now that we've put on our furisode and welcomed the new year, there's just one thing left to do: 
aqua_newyear: battledore!
megumin_newyear: Battledore?
kazuma_newyear: It's a New Year's game where you hit a feathered projectile back 
kazuma_newyear: and forth, and draw on the loser's face with ink!
darkness_newyear: With ink? Oh, just imagine the humiliating things that might 
darkness_newyear: be drawn on my face... I can't wait! Let's play!
megumin_newyear: Yeah, I'm looking forward to writing the name of the Holy Sword Excalibur on Kazuma's body.
kazuma_newyear: You write on the person's face, not their body!
aqua_newyear: Drawing on people's faces is fun and all, but how about you make us some New Year's soup if you lose, Kazuma?
kazuma_newyear: Some soup? 
kazuma_newyear: Sure, I can do that.
megumin_newyear: That sounds great! I can't wait.
kazuma_newyear: Hey, stop talking like I've already lost!
darkness_newyear: That's enough arguing. Let's get started. Whether you win 
darkness_newyear: or lose, this will be a thrilling New Year's battle!
kazuma_newyear: *Sigh* All I wanted was a relaxing holiday. Oh well, I guess 
kazuma_newyear: I might as well enjoy this.
ナレーション: Despite his complaints, Kazuma found himself looking forward to an enjoyable New Year's with his friends...
