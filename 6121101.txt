God's Blessing on This Halloween Night! (2022)
komekko_halloween: Golden confections I do desire, bequeath them to me or face my ire! 
komekko_halloween: Graaah!
miia_halloween: Totally wrong. 
miia_halloween: On Halloween, you say "Trick or treat!"
mel_halloween: Do my ears deceive me? A holiday which encourages playing tricks? 
mel_halloween: I'd better dream up something EXTRA mischievous!
erica_halloween: There are human-harvesting pumpkins on the warpath, yet everyone's so relaxed. 
erica_halloween: Is this all thanks to Kazuma?
aqua_halloween2: He certainly outdid himself this time.
Amy_halloween: Agreed. Rather than cower in fear, we'll live life to its fullest with a festival!
miia_halloween: Hear hear! 
miia_halloween: Nothin' beats food stalls jam-packed with tasty eats!
komekko_halloween: Pumpkin cookies, pumpkin cake... *Drool*
Amy_halloween: Heehee. My hungry little hellions. 
Amy_halloween: I'd better make lots of treats so I don't provoke their tricks.
mel_halloween: Wait, I implore you! I may be partial to sweets, 
mel_halloween: but this was to be a day of glorious pranks!
erica_halloween: Tricks, treatsâ€”they both sound fun to me!
aqua_halloween2: Okay, gang! It won't be the easiest chore, but let's pull together and show those pumpkins what for!
