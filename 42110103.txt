Home Again with These Pumpkins! P3
Pumpkin Pillar: As promised, you shall prepare us a delectable delicacy! 
Adventurers: Kazuma the Pumpkin Slayer! Kazuma the Pumpkin Slayer!
kazuma_halloween: I told you to stop calling me that already!
miia_halloween: Amy, ya think we're gonna have to cancel the parade? 
Amy_halloween: Don't worry, dearest! Kazuma has everything under control. 
Amy_halloween: They don't call him the Pumpkin Slayer for nothing.
kazuma_halloween: It actually is for nothing... 
megumin: Kazuma, why're you complaining? Just amaze them with a delicious meal like last year. 
darkness: Yes, I'm confident you'll be successful! 
aqua_halloween2: Just hope they don't eat you instead, Ka-zu-ma~
kazuma_halloween: If I get eaten, so do you! You know that right?! 
Pumpkin Pillar: Cease your stalling and feed us!
kazuma_halloween: Okay, okay! Fine! I'll cook your stupid meal! 
kazuma_halloween: If I remember, you wanted something to shock your taste buds. 
kazuma_halloween: The spicy cookies you ate last year are at—
Pumpkin Pillar: Nonsense! Last year's recipe will not assuage our appetite!
kazuma_halloween: I should have seen that coming. 
kazuma_halloween: What do you want, then?
Pumpkin Pillar: Something soft, yet also crispy! Something rich, yet also light in flavor! That is what we require!
kazuma_halloween: Ah, yes, yes. I understand... 
kazuma_halloween: Not! That makes no sense!
megumin: That's one absurdly unreasonable order...
Pumpkin Pillar: Food is meant to appease the spirit.
kazuma_halloween: How do a bunch of pumpkins turn into foodies?
Pumpkin Pillar: We shall return in one week's time. Do not disappoint us.
aqua_halloween2: Executive chef to the pumpkins? You sure are moving up in the world, Kazuma.
kazuma_halloween: Don't make fun of me. This is insane. 
kazuma_halloween: Their request is impossible. What am I supposed to do? 
darkness: The parade's been canceled due to the pumpkin attack, too.
megumin: We don't really have a choice until we can guarantee everyone's safety.
miia_halloween: But I was really looking forward to it... 
miia_halloween: Waaaaaahhh!
Amy_halloween: Don't cry! Oh, you poor thing. 
Amy_halloween: Here, why don't you rest your head on my lap for a bit? There, there.
miia_halloween: *Sob sob*
darkness: The pumpkins said they would return in one week. 
aqua_halloween2: Their order was something soft, yet crispy and rich, yet also light in flavor, right? 
megumin: Have you thought of a food that fulfills those conditions?
kazuma_halloween: I've got a plan! 
kazuma_halloween: ...Is what I'd like to say. But honestly I've got zilch. 
darkness: The pumpkins have been all over this world. Any ordinary dish won't do. 
Amy_halloween: Pleasing a picky eater is never an easy task.
Amy_halloween: And since they're so well-traveled, it's likely they will already have tried any foreign dish you could prepare.
kazuma_halloween: I can't exactly just cook something I've never eaten before, either. 
kazuma_halloween: Wait! 
kazuma_halloween: Well-traveled... A foreign dish...? 
kazuma_halloween: I've got it! All I have to do is cook something from Japan! 
megumin: Japan? 
megumin: That's Kazuma's homeland! He's showed us all sorts of strange things from there. 
aqua_halloween2: A Japanese dish that's soft, yet crispy and rich, yet light in flavor? You must be thinking of...
kazuma_halloween: Tempura!
miia_halloween: What's that?! Is it yummy?!
kazuma_halloween: Weren't you just crying your eyes out?! 
miia_halloween: Yeah but then you started talkin' about food! 
miia_halloween: What's this tempura thing?!
kazuma_halloween: Batter-fried fish or veggies. Done right, it's both soft and crispy, 
kazuma_halloween: and the sauce can have a rich or light flavor!
darkness: Interesting. It appears your homeland has just what we need. 
aqua_halloween2: You sure about this? Isn't tempura pretty hard to make?
kazuma_halloween: I'm confident enough in my cooking that I think I can make it work. 
kazuma_halloween: No, I WILL make it work! 
kazuma_halloween: First, we're going to need some fresh fish.
miia_halloween: If it's fish you need, the smelt you can find near Samuidoh are super yummy! 
miia_halloween: I can take ya!
kazuma_halloween: Smelt, huh? Those would be perfect for tempura.
aqua_halloween2: Alright, let's get going! 
aqua_halloween2: I bet tempura goes really good with bubbly.
