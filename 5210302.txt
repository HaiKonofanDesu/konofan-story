aqua: Are you sure about this? There are way more than I thought there'd be. 
aqua: I am not getting swallowed again today!

kazuma: Can you just not?! We've got Komekko with us today!

Giant Toad: *Riiiiiibbiiit*
darkness: Incredible... The toads have all been cooked...
horst: Mere frogs are no match for my power. 
horst: W-Wait! You summoned me again?!

komekko: That was close, huh Sis?
megumin: Th-
megumin: That's my little sister! You showed them.
kazuma: She sure did.

megumin: Wh-What did you say?!
aqua: Oh, stop fighting you two. 
aqua: Let's gather up all this toad meat and head home.
komekko: Yay! We're having meat for dinner!
