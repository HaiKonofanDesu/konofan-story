The Great Wyvern - P2 
ナレーション: Chris and Melissa engaged the wyvern hoping to secure its eggs—rare and highly valuable delicacies. 
chris: Melissa! Bind, now! 
melissa: On it! Hyah! 
Wyvern: Rrraaawwwrrr!!! 
chris: A single, swift strike to the vitals. Clean. 
melissa: What I put down should stay down. 
melissa: What about the eggs. Are they safe? 
chris: Lemme see... 
chris: All good. 
chris: Not a single crack. 
melissa: Glad to hear it. Thanks, Chris, you were a big help. 
chris: Don't mention it. Strange quests like these are often the most exciting. 
chris: This one wasn't without a bit of danger, though. 
chris: I'm honestly surprised you came, given the low reward. 
melissa: The reward is more than enough. Look at all these eggs! 
chris: You're taking them ALL?! 
melissa: Of course. A true treasure hunter never lets a prize slip by—not a single one. 
melissa: But the client only needs a few. 
melissa: But I need all the rest to sell for some serious Eris. 
chris: Hahaha. Yeah, that's the Melissa I know. 
melissa: Here, we each haul half. The quest isn't over until we get paid. 
chris: Roger that. 
chris: Hrmgh! Wow, these things are pretty heavy. 
Elderly Man: All these wyvern eggs. Simply splendid. 
Elderly Lady: And this many eggs deserves as many thanks. 
melissa: Gratitude is it's own reward. Which means it doesn't cover my actual reward. 
melissa: You did bring it, right? 
Elderly Man: Ah, yes. I have it right here. 
chris: A pocket watch? ...Really? 
melissa: It's an even better prize than I imagined. More than worth the trouble. 
melissa: Okay, Chris. As promised, here's half the reward in coin. 
chris: Oh, thank you very... 
chris: Wait, this much?! 
chris: Is this okay? 
melissa: Don't underestimate this watch's worth. Besides, I'm going to sell these eggs anyway. 
melissa: Now let's be off. 
chris: We're talking about the same watch, right? The one you just got? 
chris: How expensive could it be? 
Elderly Lady: Not very. We bought that thing ages ago for hardly anything at all. From a gift shop of all places. It doesn't even work anymore. 
chris: So why's it worth so much? Is it an antique? Is there some rare jewel embedded in it? Is it the clue to an ancient treasure? 
Elderly Man: No, it's just an old pocket watch. 
chris: Really? Are you sure? 
Elderly Man: Our son's wedding isn't far off. The boy loves eggs, and my wife wanted to prepare his favorite dishes. 
Elderly Man: Given the occasion, I figured wyvern eggs were warranted, but their rarity made them a bit out of reach. 
Elderly Lady: Truth be told, we gave up. But while we were lamenting, Melissa overheard us and offered her services. 
Elderly Lady: And all she wanted in return was the pocket watch I had. Thus, we had a deal. 
chris: So that's how it is... 
Elderly Man: We can't thank Melissa enough. Or you, for that matter. You have our undying gratitude. 
Elderly Lady: Now we can give our son the finest egg-based wedding cuisine possible. 
chris: Hehe... I'm just glad I could help. 
melissa: What are you doing? We got paid. Our business here is done. 
chris: Honestly, Melissa. Always putting up a front. 
melissa: Come on already. 
chris: Coming, coming... Oh, wait! 
chris: Before I go, here— for your son, in honor of his wedding. 
chris: It's not much, but congratulations. 
Elderly Man: Please, the eggs were more than enough. We couldn't accept more. 
chris: It's fine, really. Melissa feels the same, she's just not being upfront. 
Elderly Lady: You're far too kind. As is Providence for blessing my son so. Thank you so much. 
chris: Heh. He sounds like a lucky one all right. Well then, I'll be off. 
chris: Please give my regards to your son. 
ナレーション: Melissa had her eggs, Chris had her coin, but neither reward eclipsed the joy of giving.
