Winter Wonderland! Snowfall
ナレーション: At Kazuma's suggestion, Chris and Erika went ice skating on Samuidoh's frozen lake...
chris_winter: Look at all the people gliding around... 
chris_winter: Some are even doing jumps! I didn't know you could do that on ice.
erica_winter2: Imagine how cute we'll look gliding 
erica_winter2: across the ice. Come on, let's go!
chris_winter: So we just put on these shoes 
chris_winter: with blades on the bottom? 
chris_winter: Whoa! It's hard to keep your balance!
erica_winter2: Oh, don't be silly. 
erica_winter2: Watch how fast I start gliding like a—
erica_winter2: Eek!
chris_winter: Erika, are you okay?!
erica_winter2: Ahh, I fell... Oh, I'm not going to be able to stan— Wait!
erica_winter2: I'm fine!
chris_winter: Uh...
erica_winter2: It's these clothes. They're so fluffy that falling doesn't hurt at all! 
erica_winter2: I can get right back up and keep being cute! ♪
chris_winter: Th-That's a relief. 
chris_winter: What do you say we get back out there 
chris_winter: and keep practicing until we can skate?
erica_winter2: Sure! 
erica_winter2: But first, I'll practice looking cute when I fall.
chris_winter: Here goes! A triple axel!
erica_winter2: You're so graceful! It's enchanting to watch. You picked this up so quickly.
chris_winter: I'm a thief, remember? I know how to be light on my feet!
erica_winter2: It's not fair 
erica_winter2: that you're this good already! I want everyone to see how cute I can be too!
chris_winter: Erika... Here. Grab my hand and I'll help you. See? 
chris_winter: If we do this, we can both skate 
chris_winter: nice and smoothly.
erica_winter2: You're right. Wow, the breeze feels so nice! Thank you, 
erica_winter2: Chris! This is even more fun than I imagined!
chris_winter: Hehe, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. All right, I'm 
chris_winter: going to pick up a little speed.
Ice Skater A: Wow, I can't take my eyes off those two. They sure make a cute couple, skating together like that.
Ice Skater B: The way they glide gracefully across the ice makes them look like a princess and her prince.
erica_winter2: Everybody is looking this way... It must be because I'm so 
erica_winter2: darn cute 
erica_winter2: that it's criminal!
chris_winter: It's a little embarrassing being called a princess 
chris_winter: and her prince. Hm? Wait a minute. Which of us is the prince?
erica_winter2: Well, obviously, I would be the princess, which makes you...
chris_winter: Wh-What?!
Ice Skater A: Man, I hope I can be reborn as a handsome, silver-haired heartthrob in my next life!
chris_winter: ...Silver-haired? 
chris_winter: They're talking about me! Hey, you there! 
chris_winter: Just so you know, I am not a guy!
erica_winter2: Oh, don't make such a fuss. After all, not everybody looks like a handsome prince on the ice.
chris_winter: That's not the issue here!
