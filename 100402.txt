Selling Vegetables with These Two Beastmen! - P2
ナレーション: Along with the girls he met in Axel, Mia and Amy, Kazuma headed for the beastman village in the north...
megumin_winter: You know, I only came because I thought we had an escort mission. This is just another one of Kazuma's harebrained schemes.
darkness_winter: But to stay at home would be so boring! At the very least we can be out slaying monsters.
aqua_winter: There's so much snow... If the cart can't get through, we might have to walk.
Amy: I'm sorry. If we keep walking for another day, we'll reach the village.
kazuma_winter: Oh yeah, the village residents are all beastmen, right? So why is growing vegetables so popular?
Amy: It may seem strange, but a lot of beastmen are vegetarians. Vegetables are the staple food of the village.
miia: The north's cold and there's no rainy season. So we make the most of it an' grow diff'rent veggies all year!
miia: All the beastmen work hard to breed their veggies!
kazuma_winter: She said breed, not grow... Ah, that's right.\n
kazuma_winter: Vegetables in this world can fly and swim.
Amy: Plus, beastmen are just naturally good at raising veggies. For some reason, we breed the tastiest vegetables around.
darkness_winter: That's true...the ones Kazuma gave us were really good.
megumin_winter: Helping these people sell their delicious vegetables... I guess Kazuma has his good points, too.
Amy: Indeed. Mia and I aren't very good at sales, so Kazuma offering to help really saved us.
kazuma_winter: I simply want to help more people experience your delicious vegetables.
kazuma_winter: Actually, all I want are the exclusive sales rights. It's all in how you spin it.
darkness_winter: Kazuma, you're making that face again.
kazuma_winter: Huh?
darkness_winter: ...Let me guess. 
darkness_winter: You want to use me 
darkness_winter: as bait at the beastman village and take all of their vegetables?
kazuma_winter: Huh?
darkness_winter: It'll be just like when the cabbages attacked. They'll mob me mercilessly while you loot the place!
darkness_winter: I'm sure the northern vegetables will be even more frenzied. 
darkness_winter: My armor broken, my body exposed... Whatever will happen to me?!
miia: Hey, Amy. What's Darkness talkin' about?
Amy: Y-You might still be a bit young for this, Mia.
darkness_winter: Come, you accursed veggies! Just try and trample my pure 
darkness_winter: knight's soul! Do not hold back! Give me your worst!
kazuma_winter: *Sigh* There she goes again. I'll leave her be for now.
miia: O-Over there! Somethin' fluffy's movin' around!
Amy: Mia, it's dangerous to go off on your own!
miia: Wow, a snow sprite! And another one! And another! 
miia: They're so fluffy 'n cute!
aqua_winter: Oh, wow! So snow sprites appear up north even when it's not winter.
Amy: That's when they appear the most. But there have been more than usual lately...
miia: Ahh... They look fluffy and oh so yummy...\n
miia: *Drool*
kazuma_winter: Hey, hey, hey, hey! You wanna eat the snow sprites?!\n
kazuma_winter: We'll all be in trouble if you try to hurt them!
Amy: Northerners say, "If you harm a snow sprite, you'll earn the Winter Shogun's wrath." It's—
miia: *Chomp*
Aqua, Megumin ＆ Darkness: Ahh!
Amy: M-Mia?!\n
Amy: You'll get a tummy ache, so don't eat more than one.
kazuma_winter: That's not the point! What happened to the "not harming snow sprites" thing?!
miia: I didn't harm them, I just ate them!
kazuma_winter: THAT'S NO EXCUSE!!
Winter Shogun: Grrroooaaarrr!
kazuma_winter: It's... It's... IT'S HERE!!
kazuma_winter: Why did he have to appear right next to me?! That's not fair! 
aqua_winter: You're really panicking, Kazuma. You must've really been traumatized from him killing you.
kazuma_winter: Aaaaaaugh! Megumin, save me! Use your explosion magic on this—
megumin_winter: No way! At this range, everyone'll get caught in the blast!
darkness_winter: Kazuma, get down on your knees and apologize!
darkness_winter: *Pant pant* The humiliation of being forced to grovel in the snow... I think I like it!
kazuma_winter: This isn't the time for your weird quirks!
Winter Shogun: Grrroooaaarrr!
aqua_winter: Kazuma! Behind you—
kazuma_winter: Ah—
kazuma_winter: Everything's gone dark. That means I'm...
eris: So, you have returned.
kazuma_jersey: Yeah, I was hoping to see you again.
eris: My condolences for how you got caught up in that...
kazuma_jersey: Sorry I haven't learned from my mistakes. 
kazuma_jersey: I tried to stop them, you know? I thought this might happen.
kazuma_jersey: But maybe, just maybe... I was looking forward to seeing you, Eris.
eris: Huh?
ナレーション: Kazuma's face flushed as he averted his gaze, while Eris also blushed and looked away...
