First Anniversary Episode (1 day prior)
iris: Brother! Tomorrow will be one year since we met. 
iris: Congratulations!
kazuma: Thanks, Iris. One year, eh... 
kazuma: It was a long one, but it 
kazuma: went by 
kazuma: in a flash...
iris: I enjoyed myself immensely. I invited you to the ball, and had you take me on an adventure... 
iris: Swinging a sword with you in the desert is one of my fondest memories!
kazuma: I'm glad to hear it, but I didn't get you 
kazuma: into trouble, did I? You came to Axel too, after all.
iris: Rain and Claire were fine. Beneath their serious demeanor, they are both quite kindhearted. 
iris: However, I would rather hear about your favorite memories.
kazuma: Hm, getting chocolate from you and the girls was nice. Just thinking about it fills my heart all over again. 
kazuma: But my best memory was probably becoming the producer for Axel Heartsâ€”even if it was 
kazuma: a lot of trouble.
iris: You're amazing, Brother... 
iris: Um, maybe someday, if you feel like it, you might take me on another adventure?
kazuma: Of course! Let's visit plenty of new places 
kazuma: this year!
