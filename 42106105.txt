A Harvest Festival for This Northern Land! - P5
chris_samuido: *Nom nom* Mmm... Everything's so crisp and delicious! I could eat forever. 
squall_samuido: Only about half our Gluttonous Dedication contestants remain, but our visitor from Axel is still going strong!
darkness_winter: Chris, you're a natural!
chris_samuido: I'm just as surprised as you. 
chris_samuido: The vegetables here are so delicious, though. I just keep going. 
miia_samuido: *Munch munch* I could eat these all day too, but I'd rather be 
miia_samuido: eating meat! 
megumin_winter: Look at Mia go. It's hard to believe she just ate an entire cartload of tomatoes before this.
kazuma_winter: I imagined their ritual to be a bit more formal, but this is actually pretty rambunctious. 
Amy_samuido: Mia, Chris, good luck!
squall_samuido: Despite having to drop out herself, Amy continues to cheer 
squall_samuido: on our other contestants! What valiant sportsmanship!
squall_samuido: Ahem... All this shouting is sure drying out my throat. 
squall_samuido: Could someone grab me a drink?
aqua_winter: If you're looking for a drink, I've got you covered! 
aqua_winter: Here!
squall_samuido: Oh, thank— 
squall_samuido: Blech! What is this?!
aqua_winter: It's a special, high concentration bubbly.
kazuma_winter: What are you giving him that for?! What's wrong with you?!
aqua_winter: He said he wanted a drink! What's wrong with some bubbly?! This is a celebration, isn't it?!
squall_samuido: Nngh... I need to sit down... 
squall_samuido: Megumin, would you take over?
megumin_winter: We're approaching the end! Our final two brave contestants soldiering forward are Chris and Mia!
darkness_winter: She took to that quickly. 
kazuma_winter: She is a bit of a show-off, so this is right up her alley.
miia_samuido: *Nom nom* 
miia_samuido: I could keep going, but I'm getting a little bored of only vegetables.
chris_samuido: Hnng... *Munch munch*
megumin_winter: What's this? Mia's dedication has no end! Chris, however, seems to be slowing down!
megumin_winter: Who will claim this year's title of Grand Vegetal?!
kazuma_winter: She's really getting into this emcee thing, isn't she?
darkness_winter: Although, I believe I feel the sentiment. This is turning into quite the suspenseful competition.
aqua_winter: Which one is going to win, though? What do you 
aqua_winter: think, Squall? Wait, what the—?!
squall_samuido: Zzz...
aqua_winter: Squall! What are you doing?! Wake up! You can't miss the end of the contest!
squall_samuido: Hrm... Zzz...
aqua_winter: Squall, are you listening?! I said wake up!
kazuma_winter: Aqua, don't! Waking Squall up like that will—
aqua_winter: Wake up this instant, Squall!
squall_samuido: Hrn...
aqua_winter: Good, you're finally awake—
squall_samuido: WHO DARES TO DISTURB MY SLEEP?! 
squall_samuido: 　
aqua_winter: GRAAAAAH!
squall_samuido: There is but one fate awaiting those who awaken me!
kazuma_winter: S-Squall, calm down!
squall_samuido: Silence!
Villager A: This is bad! Squall is rampaging again!
Villager B: Forget the festival! Everybody run for your lives!
darkness_winter: Squall, please calm down!
squall_samuido: DEATH TO ALL! GRAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
aqua_winter: What's gotten into him?!
kazuma_winter: This is all your fault! How did you forget he hates being woken up!
chris_samuido: What's all the ruckus? 
chris_samuido: Huh?! Squall...?! 
chris_samuido: Mia, this is no time to be eating!
miia_samuido: Hmm? Are you giving up?
chris_samuido: No, just look! We need to stop Squall!
