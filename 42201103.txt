A Little Luck for This New Year! - P3 
iris_newyear: The mochi soup was great. 
iris_newyear: I also enjoyed the tops and the face-making game with the paper parts—"fukuwarai," was it? 
kazuma_newyear: Don't think we'll lay off the New Year's fun just yet. Today, we'll be flying this thing! 
megumin_newyear: Yay! Kites! 
iris_newyear: "Kites"? 
iris_newyear: I am familiar with the birds known as running hawk kites. Are they related? 
darkness_newyear: A kite is a toy made out of wood and paper. Attach a string, let it catch the wind, and watch it fly. This one's cabbage-shaped. 
aqua_newyear: I wanted to make a colossal flying Destroyer... 
aqua_newyear: but Kazuma said that would be "dangerous" and "probably lead to something exploding somehow." 
megumin_newyear: A flying Destroyer?! 
megumin_newyear: I so want to see that! 
kazuma_newyear: See? If Megumin likes it, it's sure to send the town into panic! 
kazuma_newyear: Hence, we're going with the humble cabbage. 
kazuma_newyear: All we need is an open space to fly it in. 
ynyn_newyear: Mochi! Get your mochi here! 
ynyn_newyear: Skill potion-infused mochi! It's the perfect snack for the health-conscious! 
ynyn_newyear: Munch a bunch of munchy mochi! 
megumin_newyear: ...Yunyun? 
ynyn_newyear: M-Megumin?! Mochi for your munchies? 
kazuma_newyear: "Munchies"? 
kazuma_newyear: Wait, no. What are you doing? And why are you doing it in a kimono? 
ynyn_newyear: I'm helping Wiz out with business. 
ynyn_newyear: Vanir told me to wear this and sell mochi. 
aqua_newyear: How dare that masked monster so cruelly exploit humans like this! 

aqua_newyear: And worse, how dare he make a kimono! 
darkness_newyear: Don't you think you're overreacting? 
darkness_newyear: Yunyun, you look beautiful. 
ynyn_newyear: Th-Thanks. You know, matching attire on New Year's is kind of...almost...maybe feels like...
ynyn_newyear: we're actually friends— 
megumin_newyear: I don't care how friendless you are. Selling your soul to a demon? 
megumin_newyear: You're a disgrace to our clan. 
ynyn_newyear: You've got it all wrong. I'm selling mochi, not souls! Did my pitch not mention mochi enough? 
iris_newyear: Vanir's selling mochi? 
iris_newyear: Brother, might I take a quick peek before we fly kites? 
wiz_newyear: Welcome! And a Happy New Year to you all. 
kazuma_newyear: Right back at you. 
kazuma_newyear: I see you're both dressed for the occasion. 
banil_newyear: That we are! 
banil_newyear: Few garments, no matter how grand, no matter how intricate, can compare to those wrought by my own hands! 
banil_newyear: I'm a demon first, but a craftsmen second. 
banil_newyear: Are these not the finest kimono you've ever beheld? 
aqua_newyear: Amazing! For an amateur with no fashion sense. 
aqua_newyear: I could've made you something people actually liked looking at. 
iris_newyear: Oh? I'm not very experienced, so I can't notice the difference. 
banil_newyear: Hmph! A craftsman who only looks for faults is a master of no craft. 
aqua_newyear: You got a problem with me? You doubting my divine needlework? 
aqua_newyear: This is exactly why I despise demons like you. 
banil_newyear: My problem is that you're the one with the problem. 
banil_newyear: This is exactly why I despise amateurs like you. 
kazuma_newyear: Enough! What kind of New Year starts with arguing about clothing? 
darkness_newyear: We ran into Yunyun on the way. I see you're dabbling in the mochi business now? 
banil_newyear: Indeed. Healthy, delicious, and good for your skin. 
banil_newyear: We call it "Magnificent Makeover Mochi"! A snack to make you a snack! 
wiz_newyear: But we are still a magic item store first and foremost. 
banil_newyear: Fool! That side of our business only drags us down! 
banil_newyear: If only this store wasn't stocked with useless junk full of mysterious, ancient power, we wouldn't need to sell mochi in the first place! 
kazuma_newyear: Well? Is the mochi selling? 
banil_newyear: Of course it is! 
wiz_newyear: It would be great if it kick started the magic item side of our business somehow. 
wiz_newyear: Any ideas? 
kazuma_newyear: For successful business? 
kazuma_newyear: Not any helpful ones... 
iris_newyear: If I may suggest, why not search for a money cat? 
Megumin, Darkness, Wiz: Money cat? 
iris_newyear: It's a rare, cat-like monster. 
iris_newyear: It is said that good luck will come to any who catch it. 
iris_newyear: Adventurers who have done so became rich almost instantly. 
aqua_newyear: Like, rich rich? 
aqua_newyear: I can be a cat person if it petting it will make me rich! 
kazuma_newyear: A cat-like monster that attracts wealth? That almost sounds like a "maneki neko." 
wiz_newyear: A what? 
kazuma_newyear: It's a type of cat statue from back home. 
kazuma_newyear: A raised right hand invites money. 
kazuma_newyear: While a raised left hand invites customers. 
banil_newyear: Well, we might as well start the new year off with some good luck. 
banil_newyear: Come, pitiful shopkeeper! Prepare to get lucky! 
wiz_newyear: Huh? Right now?! 
wiz_newyear: What about the shop we're trying to save? 
banil_newyear: We're closed until we catch that cat and don't even need the shop! 
aqua_newyear: Trust me, you'll still need the shop. That money cat belongs to us! 
aqua_newyear: I've earned a life of glitz and glamor! I just need a magic cat to give it to me! 
kazuma_newyear: I don't condone the actions of such a selfish, greedy goddess. 
kazuma_newyear: But selfish, greedy me? 
kazuma_newyear: It only makes sense. 
darkness_newyear: We're all going then, I take it? This will mark our first quest of the year. 
megumin_newyear: In that case, we might as well bring Yunyun with us. 
megumin_newyear: She looked so lonely back there. 
iris_newyear: I've never actually seen a money cat in person... 
iris_newyear: Please, let me go with you! 
kazuma_newyear: It's settled, then. 
kazuma_newyear: Time to find us a REAL maneki neko!
