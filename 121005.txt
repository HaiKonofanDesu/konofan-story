God's Blessing on This Fabulous Friendship! - P5
melcharlie: I'm so excited for tomorrow!
daniel: Charlie, you surprised me! Refrain from 
daniel: shouting without warning me first!
melcharlie: Oh, my apologies, Lord Daniel. I'm just positively charged 
melcharlie: with excitement! Cielo will be mine after we claim Axel!
daniel: Haha! Yes she will be! With your lightning powers, those insects 
daniel: are no match for us! The Axel girls will be ours!
daniel: However, I would ask that you keep your voice down after dark.
melcharlie: I do apologize, but I simply have more energy than I know 
melcharlie: what to do with! I feel like running laps around the castle!
daniel: You're like a puppy experiencing its first snow. 
daniel: Save your energy. Tomorrow will come soon enough.
？？？: Light...ning... Bolt!
daniel: Did you hear a voice? Something tickled my arm a little! 
daniel: Hm?
daniel: Charlie! We have a late night visitor! What brings you to our castle?
mel: *Pant pant* I'm here...to take back what you two 
mel: took from me...
melcharlie: What was that? I haven't the slightest idea what you might 
melcharlie: be referring to. How about you, Lord Daniel?
daniel: I too am at a loss. By the way, Charlie, this new, charged 
daniel: look of yours is simply, how do I say, electrifying.
melcharlie: It is, isn't it?! I make an even better lightning spirit than this one ever did, if I do say so myself!
mel: Give it back right now! 
mel: Light...ning... Bolt!
melcharlie: Mwahaha! How pathetic!
daniel: It pains me to say so, little friend, but we no longer have any 
daniel: need for you. Why don't you run along home now?
mel: *Pant* I refuse! I won't let you hurt anyone! 
mel: I won't be a burden to them anymore!
daniel: Hmm, I see our guest is a rather stubborn one. If you aren't willing to go when we ask nicely, you leave us no choice.
daniel: It's time for a lesson! Charlie, 
daniel: teach this one some manners!
melcharlie: With pleasure, my lord! 
melcharlie: Lightn—
？？？: Light of Saber!
melcharlie: Ack! 
melcharlie: What was that? 
ynyn: Mel, let's get out of here! Quick, I'll help you walk!
mel: Y-Yunyun?!
ynyn: *Pant pant* 
ynyn: I think we managed to lose them for now.
mel: What are you doing here, Yunyun?
ynyn: Mel, how could you run off on your own like that?! I was so worried!
mel: I'm sorry... But it's my fault the town is in danger...
ynyn: It's not your fault, Mel. In fact, it's times like these 
ynyn: when you should lean on others for help!
mel: But...why would you go this far just for me?
ynyn: That's... 
ynyn: b-because we're friends, of course!
mel: Yunyun! *Sob* 
mel: You don't know how happy that makes me. 
mel: What do I do? You're making me cry. 
melcharlie: Sorry to interrupt such a touching moment.
daniel: You two pests sure are quick on your feet.
melcharlie: You've made a mistake! Out here in the open, I don't 
melcharlie: have to worry about holding back my power.
ynyn: Oh no! I don't think I can carry Mel much further.
melcharlie: This time, I'll finish you for—
？？？: Hold it right there!
melcharlie: Gaaah! Stop interrupting me right before I get to the good 
melcharlie: part! Who is it this time?!
mel: Kazuma!
darkness: Why do you look so surprised to see us?
lia: Yunyun's not your only friend, you know.
aqua: I've already got food and bubbly waiting for us, 
aqua: so hurry and clobber these guys!
iris_battle: These trolls' evil deeds shall not go unpunished!
dust: I believe in everyone. Knock 'em dead.
lean: Do you think you're a cheerleader? You're helping too!
ynyn: Dust! Rin! Everyone came here to help!
megumin: Just to be clear, we're only here for Mel. It's not like we got 
megumin: worried when we realized you were gone too, Yunyun.
kazuma: Is that so? I remember a certain explosion mage being worried sick.
daniel: Hehehe. It matters not how many weaklings you bring. Thor's Hammer was nothing compared to the power 
daniel: we now possess!
daniel: Rrraaagh!!!
melcharlie: Lord Daniel is correct! How dare you think yourselves 
melcharlie: worthy of fighting him! I shall be your opponent!
kazuma: Is everyone ready?! Aqua! Cielo! Amy! Cast Protection 
kazuma: on those in the vanguard!
Aqua, Cielo, Amy: Protection!
kazuma: Front line, slow them down as best you can! 
Mitsurugi, Dust, Lia: Roger!
kazuma: Chris and Melissa, use Bind to restrict their movements! 
kazuma: Iris, keep 'em in check with Extellion!
iris_battle: You can count on me, Brother!
kazuma: Wiz! Rain! You're up!
wiz: Understood! Ready, and—!
Wiz, Rain: Cursed Crystal Prison!
melcharlie: Gah! 
melcharlie: This ice isn't enough to hold me!
kazuma: Now, Megumin! Give 'em the biggest blast we've ever seen!
megumin: Evildoers encased in freezing ice! On this night, you shall meet your ends within a column of crimson flame!
megumin: EXPLOSION!!!
megumin: That... 
megumin: felt absolutely amazing...
daniel_troll: *Pant pant* 
daniel_troll: Charlie, if you're still alive, answer me!
melcharlie: Unghhh... 
melcharlie: F-Fear not...
daniel_troll: Splendid! 
daniel_troll: We've been foiled once again. We will retreat and regroup.
kazuma: Sorry, but not this time. 
daniel_troll: Hm? The ice is turning into a thick fog...
kazuma: Rin, now! Just like we discussed!
lean: I'm on it! 
lean: Wind Breath!
daniel_troll: They've turned the fog into a cloud and are using wind to create friction... 
daniel_troll: Oh, no! This is bad!
melcharlie: What's so bad about a cloud, Lord Daniel?!
kazuma: Mel! Behold your prankmaster's greatest work yet!
Daniel, Charlie: WHAAAAAA!!!
Daniel, Charlie: AAAAAAHHH!!!
aqua: That was amazing, Kazuma! I can't believe you actually created lightning!
clair: I would have never thought to combine different magics together like that.
kazuma: Just something I remembered from science class.
darkness: What about Mel?
mel: Wow... 
mel: I can feel my power coming back!
kazuma: All right! It worked!
mel: Kazuma! Everyone! I'm sorry for burdening you again! 
mel: But now's my chance 
mel: to make it up to you!
daniel_troll: Don't think you've one just because Mel has her 
daniel_troll: powers back! Charlie! Use the relic once more!
melcharlie: Rrrraaagh!!!
