God's Blessing on Those from DanMachi! - P5
megumin: This should be where Bell and the others first appeared. I don't see any sign of the flash lizard runner, though.
kazuma: No surprise there. I never expected it to be that easy—
Flash Lizard Runner: Rwaaa... Rwaaahhh...
bell: Th-There it is!
aqua_D: It's fast asleep...
aiz: How strange. It's left itself completely open to attack. 
kazuma: No complaints here. All I have to do is 
kazuma: sneak a bit closer and... Hyah! Bind!
Flash Lizard Runner: Rwaaahhh!
Flash Lizard Runner: 　　
kazuma: What the—?! It just disappeared!
liliruca: Kazuma! Above you!
kazuma: Huh? Above me?
Giant Toads: Crooooooak!
kazuma: Whaaaaaat?! Why are there giant toads falling from the sky?!
megumin: It's just like when Hestia and the others first appeared. Is this the lizard's doing?
hestia: Eek! Why are these frogs so huge?!
kazuma: Watch out! If you're not careful, they'll—
aqua_D: Kazumaaa! Help!
kazuma: How are you already getting eaten?!
Giant Toad A: *Chomp*
hestia: Gw
hestia: aaah!
bell: Aaah! Goddess!
hestia: S-Someone help meee! It's warm and slimy!
aqua_D: It smells so bad... Please help...
liliruca: Quickly! We need to rescue them!
megumin: Liliruca, don't let yourself panic. They won't be immediately devoured. 
liliruca: A-Are you sure?
megumin: Yes, I've experienced it firsthand. So long as they aren't too hungry, they—
hestia: Wh-What are you 
hestia: waiting for— 
hestia: Glrrrrg...
aqua_D: It's different this time! I'm really gonna die! 
aqua_D: Glrrrg
aqua_D: ...
bell: G-Goddess!
hestia: Hnggg... I'm completely covered in slime. 
hestia: Bell, I've been defiled...
bell: Forgive me, Goddess. I wasn't able to protect you...
hestia: It's all right, Bell. You are forgiven. So long as you...let me give 
hestia: you a big hug!
bell: G-
bell: Goddess! 
bell: Blech! You're getting me all slimy too!
aqua_D: Kazuma... 
aqua_D: Aren't you going to say sorry to me too? 
kazuma: I saved you, and you're still whining? This isn't our first time fighting these things, 
kazuma: useless goddess!
aqua_D: Waaah! Why can't I be treated like 
aqua_D: Hestia?! Fine! For that, you get covered in slime too!
Flash Lizard Runner: Rrraaagggh!
megumin: Ah! The flash lizard runner is back!
hestia: It's this thing's fault I'm covered in this slime! 
hestia: Sit still and let us capture you already!
Flash Lizard Runner: Rrraaagggh?
aqua_D: I blame you for this difference in divine deference. You're going to pay!
Flash Lizard Runner: Rrraaagh?!
liliruca: The flash lizard runner is being overwhelmed by the goddess' vengeful auras.
kazuma: All this over getting eaten by a toad.
Flash Lizard Runner: Rrraaagggh!
aqua_D: Hey, get back here! How many times are you planning 
aqua_D: on run—Hey! Something's coming!
Minotaurs: Rrraaaaaawwwrrr!
bell: The minotaurs! They've returned!
aiz: It would seem we've been surrounded. We've no choice but to fight.
kazuma: This is starting to look serious!
darkness_D: Don't worry, Kazuma! You have a human shield that can also land attacks now! There is nothing to fear! 
darkness_D: Hahaha!
aqua_D: There's plenty of slimy anger to go around. Let's get them!
hestia: Go, Bell! Get revenge for my mistreatment!
bell: Right away, Goddess!
