The Great Wyvern - P2
ナレーション: Kazuma and company finally caught up to Yunyun and found her valiantly battling against a wyvern...
ynyn: *Pant pant* This thing sure is tough.
Great Wyvern: Graaaaaahhh!
ynyn: But it's time to finish this... 
ynyn: M-My name is Yunyun! Master practitioner of advanced magic and Megumin's fiercest rival! 
ynyn: Light of Saber!
Great Wyvern: Rrraaaggghhh!
kazuma: Wow! Is it just me, or was that attack way more powerful than it was the last time I saw it?
aqua: Yunyun's pouring her heart into her attacks.
darkness: Interesting. This must be an expression of just how fervently she desires to battle Megumin.
ynyn: *Pant pant* 
ynyn: I-Is it over?
megumin: Splendid work, Yunyun.
ynyn: M-Megumin?! Y-You were watching?!
megumin: I was going to jump in if things got dangerous, but it seems you handled things just fine on your own.
ynyn: Megumin... 
ynyn: Thanks. So does that mean...?
megumin: Yes. Let's have a duel. 
megumin: Right here and now!
ynyn: Th-thank you! 
ynyn: I used quite a bit of energy in that battle, though. Perhaps tomorrow would be—
megumin: We will have our duel right now!
ynyn: Wh-Whaaat?!
megumin: We shall use classic martial arts, and the victor shall win the spoils from this quest! How does that sound?!
darkness: Haha, that seems a bit unfair...
aqua: I think she's been learning bad habits from spending so much time around Kazuma...
kazuma: Who's the bad influence, you say?
ynyn: Wait, Megumin! I-I'm nearly out of magic power and my stamina isn't—
megumin: No 
megumin: excuses!
ynyn: Aaaaaahhh! B-But I'm too exhausted to—
megumin: Hyah!
ynyn: U-Urnnngh...
megumin: I win again!
aqua: That was an impressive shoulder throw...
kazuma: Impressive, but still a cheap shot...
ynyn: Y-You're so mean, Megumin...
ynyn: I guess I did get to duel you, though... I'm exhausted, but that was...fun... I think...
ナレーション: Although exhausted and on the verge of unconsciousness, Yunyun was already planning her next duel with Megumin...
