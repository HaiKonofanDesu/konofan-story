Lion Dancer Cub: *Munch munch*
kazuma_newyear: Yeooouch! Why won't you let go of me?!
luna: Oh, my. What a cute little lion dancer cub.
megumin_newyear: It seems to have taken a liking to Kazuma.
darkness_newyear: I would gladly trade places with him 
darkness_newyear: if I could.
kazuma_newyear: Could you stop chatting and help me?!
aqua_newyear: This isn't a curse, so I don't really know what to do. 
aqua_newyear: Do you have any suggestions?
luna: Let's see... Lion dancers are a type of spirit that you 
luna: sometimes see this time of year.
luna: I've heard the jaws of full-grown lion dancers are powerful enough to bite through bone.
kazuma_newyear: Seriously? 
kazuma_newyear: Can someone help me already?!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Nom nom*
luna: I don't think you have to worry about that, though. This one's just a cub. 
luna: Ah, who's a little cutie...?
kazuma_newyear: Um, Miss Luna...?
luna: Oh, I'm sorry! It's just so sweet and innocent that 
luna: I couldn't help myself.
kazuma_newyear: Can you at least try to focus?! 
kazuma_newyear: This is serious!
luna: Let's see. How does one induce a lion dancer to 
luna: let go...? Oh, I remember! They love festivals!
megumin_newyear: Sounds like Aqua.
aqua_newyear: Oh, we'd get along great! I kind of like the idea of performing Nature's Beauty 
aqua_newyear: with a lion dancer!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Chomp chomp*
kazuma_newyear: Ouch! It's biting down even harder! Don't get 
kazuma_newyear: off topic, Aqua! Just get this thing off of me!
luna: From what I've heard, they enjoy the sound of flutes and drums. Perhaps we could try playing some music for it.
kazuma_newyear: Flutes and drums? Great. Thank you for your assistance, 
kazuma_newyear: Miss Luna! I really appreciate it!
darkness_newyear: Kazuma, I managed to find a drum.
megumin_newyear: Kazuma, Kazuma! I have procured a flute!
aqua_newyear: We found a group of street performers. 
aqua_newyear: When I said I was a fellow entertainer, they were happy to let us borrow their instruments!
Entertainer A: This blue-haired beauty's performance was quite impressive! I hope you'll play for us again sometime!
Entertainer B: Such talent for someone so young. It gives me hope for the future of the performing arts!
aqua_newyear: See? Aren't they nice? 
aqua_newyear: Thank you!
kazuma_newyear: Spreading your influence again, I see... 
kazuma_newyear: You never change.
Lion Dancer Cub: *Chomp chomp* *Crunch*
kazuma_newyear: Aaaaaagh! That hurts! Please, just play the instruments already, will you?!
darkness_newyear: Leave it to us! Come on, Megumin!
megumin_newyear: R-Right! I am totally prepared for this! 
megumin_newyear: Here goes!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Munch munch munch*
kazuma_newyear: Yeooouuuch!!! What was that?! 
kazuma_newyear: The lion dancer hates it!
megumin_newyear: No good, huh? I've never played the flute before, 
megumin_newyear: so I was kind of expecting this.
kazuma_newyear: Then why did you say you were ready?! Aqua, do something!
aqua_newyear: You got it! 
Lion Dancer Cub: Awoo-ooo! ♪
megumin_newyear: Look! The lion dancer let go!
kazuma_newyear: Hrng... My whole leg is bruised...
aqua_newyear: Oh, come now Kazuma. There's no reason to be upset. 
aqua_newyear: It's only a child, after all!
darkness_newyear: Aqua's right—it was just a child. We should consider this matter settled and move on.
megumin_newyear: That's right. If you compose yourself, we can finally 
megumin_newyear: have some of that mochi! We've been waiting all day.
Lion Dancer Cub: *Chomp*
kazuma_newyear: Oh, the mochi!
Lion Dancer Cub: Awooo!
aqua_newyear: Hey, the lion dancer cub just stole our mochi and ran off!
aqua_newyear: How are we supposed to make our special New Year's soup?! 
aqua_newyear: Get back here, you little mochi thief!
kazuma_newyear: What happened to not getting upset because it's a child?
aqua_newyear: Now's not the time to argue! We have to go after it! 
aqua_newyear: Hey, give us back our mochi!
