A Magic Item for This Amnesiac Princess! P2
ナレーション: While Kazuma prepares for the night of his dreams with Carla, a lone knight rides into town... 
？？？: I was not expecting to have to return here... 
？？？: Do not fret, Lady Iris! I shall retrieve Sir Kazuma if it is the last thing I do! 
kazuma: Hey everyone! 
kazuma: I'm back!
aqua: Hey! Took ya long enough, lazy bum! 
megumin_lightcloth: You're late! We've been waiting for so long. 
kazuma: Wha, did you miss me that much? 
kazuma: Sorry about that, I was consoling Dust and lost track of the time. 
kazuma: Huh?! What's with the mouth-watering spread?! 
darkness: Kazuma! Guess what we're having for dinner! All the way from my hometown... 
darkness: It's milky oysters! 
kazuma: Say what? Milky what now...?
megumin_lightcloth: It's a delicacy too lavish for most any household! 
darkness: I thought we needed a tasty meal to rejuvenate our desire to go questing! So, my treat! 
aqua: And I brought the bubbly! 
aqua: Nothing goes better with oysters than bubbly! Let's go wild tonight! Woohoo! 
kazuma: ...Dammit! I'm not allowed to eat and drink too much tonight! 
kazuma: And I need to get to bed early too!
darkness: What are you waiting for, Kazuma? There's more than enough for everyone, so dig in.
megumin_lightcloth: Famous last words, Darkness. He'll have eaten the lot before you've even picked up your fork.
aqua: Ack, you're right! Look here, Kazuma. This side of the table is all mine, okay?! 
kazuma: Err... Whatever you say. Ehehe. 
megumin_lightcloth: Raise your glasses! 
darkness: A toast to our great accomplishments! And to many more to come! 
darkness: Cheers! 
Aqua, Megumin: Cheers!
kazuma: Ch-Cheers... 
aqua: Phwaaa! There's really nothing better than bubbly and oysters! 
aqua: This is the best! 
megumin_lightcloth: Mmm... Down you go! *Slurp* 
megumin_lightcloth: Mmmmm! My heart is set ablaze!
darkness: Oh my, these are even better than I remembered... 
darkness: I can't stop myself! 
kazuma: Th-This is so unfair. 
aqua: Hey, check this out, Kazuma! Open up the oyster and pour bubbly into the shell... 
aqua: Then grill it on the fire! 
aqua: Bubbly-steamed oysters! You have to try it! Woowee! 
aqua: I'm a genius!
kazuma: Urk... She's cooking them like she did the crab. 
kazuma: Is she trying to tempt me?! Must. Stay. Strong. 
darkness: Kazuma? Why aren't you eating? 
darkness: Could it be that you don't like milky oysters?
kazuma: I love oysters! I love them so much! It's just... Ngh... This is a tough choice... 
kazuma: No, I can't lose my nerve now! Get a grip! 
kazuma: I'm sorry, Darkness. 
kazuma: I ended up eating with Dust. I think I'm just gonna head to bed. Good night! 
darkness: But Kazuma?! 
megumin_lightcloth: Leave him, Darkness. He seems like he's fine.
aqua: Well, if he doesn't want them, that's just more for us! 
aqua: I cooked your oysters in the bubbly, Darkness. 
kazuma_jersey: Phew... I dodged a bullet there. One bite and I would have lost control completely. 
kazuma_jersey: I've disabled Aqua's protective barrier and now sweet dreams await me... 
kazuma_jersey: A bevy of beautiful blond women acting oh so indecently and tussling about... Heh. 
kazuma_jersey: Bless you, Carla! 
kazuma_jersey: See you 
kazuma_jersey: soon...
kazuma_jersey: Zzz... 
？？？: ...zuma? Kazuma! 
kazuma_jersey: ...Hm? Is it starting?
？？？: Awaken, Sir Kazuma! 
kazuma_jersey: Sir? I'm not really into that kind of stuff, Carla. 
？？？: GET UP!!! And get ready!
kazuma_jersey: N-Ngh...? 
aqua: Ah, he's waking up, you guys. Wakey-wakey! 
kazuma_jersey: Get ready? 
kazuma_jersey: Ah, it's started, hasn't it... 
darkness: Are you still asleep? Miss Claire has come all this way, Kazuma. Don't be rude.
kazuma_jersey: ...Huh? Claire? 
kazuma_jersey: Why would Claire be here? I don't want her to be in it!
clair: Be in what? I think he's still half-asleep. 
clair: Truly, what does Lady Iris see in this pathetic cretin?! 
megumin: Come on, lazybones. Up and at 'em. We've been summoned to deal with an emergency. 
clair: You must accompany me to the castle. Quickly. Get your things. 
kazuma_jersey: The castle? Now...? 
kazuma_jersey: I-I'm not going anywhere! I'm going back to bed! 
kazuma_jersey: I paid good money for tonight, okay?! 
darkness: Money...? Of course you would... 
clair: If compensation is what you require, we will see to it that you're paid. 
clair: Please... Lady Iris is in 
clair: need of your help! 
kazuma_jersey: Iris is in trouble? 
kazuma_jersey: What happened?
clair: There is no time to explain. I'll explain everything once we get to the castle.
kazuma_jersey: Claire wouldn't come here and say Iris is in trouble for nothing. It must be serious. 
kazuma_jersey: Sorry, Carla! Maybe next time! 
kazuma_jersey: Okay, give me a minute to get ready! 
kazuma_jersey: I'll have to leave her a note... 
ナレーション: Kazuma left a note for Carla and headed for the capital.
