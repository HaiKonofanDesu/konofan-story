God's Blessing on Cielo's Birthday! (2022)
Kazuma, Lia, Erika: Happy birthday, Cielo!
erica: Here's a little something from all of us—
erica: a big adorable stuffed bear!
cielo: Wow! I've had my eye on this for a while! 
cielo: Thanks for making it all the way out here, everyone!
cielo: Thank you!
lia: We figured doing it at your place would prevent any mishaps with your fear of men. 
lia: Plus, your parents can join.
erica: Speaking of Cielo's parents, where's her dad?
kazuma: Probably getting her present ready. 
kazuma: He seemed super fired up about the whole thing...
reuenthal: Ciruelto! At long last, all is ready! 
reuenthal: Hraaah!
cielo: F-Father? 
cielo: Your aura... It hungers for battle!
reuenthal: Indeed. For I have just finished meditating 
reuenthal: in anticipation of fulfilling the second tenet of the Reuentahl creed!
cielo: *Gasp* 
cielo: "One's growth must be demonstrated...by the fist!"
reuenthal: Exactly, Ciruelto! Now show me you've got! 
reuenthal: Win this, 
reuenthal: and an even bigger stuffed bear 
reuenthal: shall be yours!
erica: It's...gargantuan! 
erica: Past the point of cute. Scary, even.
kazuma: She's your kid, man! Just GIVE it to her.
cielo: Very well, Father. I accept your challenge! But know this! 
cielo: I will not be defeated!
lia: Now Cielo's ready to throw down too...
kazuma: Like father, like daughter, I suppose... 
kazuma: But so long as they're both game, why not?
reuenthal: Come, Ciruelto! For the fight has now begun! 
reuenthal: Haaaaaappy birthdaaaaaaaaay!
cielo: Thank you, 
cielo: Faaaaaaaaather!
ナレーション: The duel lasted well into the night, with Cielo barely emerging triumphant. And so, the bear went to the victor.
