Amy - P2
ナレーション: One day, Amy was lost in the crowd on a street in Axel...
Amy: *Fidget* Uhh... Uhh... Am I really going to be okay?
kazuma: Amy? What are you doing here?
Amy: Ah, Kazuma. Good afternoon.
Amy: Wait! This is no good. Come over here, Kazuma!
Amy: Kazuma, do you know who that is over there?
kazuma: Hm? Oh, isn't that Mia?
miia: Lalalalalala... ♪ Time to run some errands! ♪
Amy: I asked her to run an errand. She's picking up some fish for tonight's supper.
kazuma: So Mia's doing the shopping for dinner tonight.\n
kazuma: Then why are you following her?
Amy: I can't help but worry about her while she's shopping. What if she gets kidnapped or...something?
kazuma: You really are overprotective.
Amy: Look, Kazuma! Mia's stopped in front of a street stall.
miia: Just to remind myself... We're having some delicious fish for supper tonight.
miia: I can't forget... Fish. Fish. Fish...
Butcher: Hey, welcome! Take a gander, little one!
miia: It's a butcher shop... 
miia: No meat today. I need fish.
Butcher: Don't be so hasty now. Check out our shop's specialty! Smoke lizard skewers, delicious and easy to make!
miia: Ooh, that does looks tasty. And if they're easy to make, Amy's sure to... 
miia: No! I can't!
miia: I have shopping to do! Amy is counting on me.\n
miia: But it sure looks yummy... *Drool*
kazuma: Hey, she's getting distracted.
Amy: Mia's resolve is being tested. It's so cute!
kazuma: That's not the point. She's going to fail her mission. Maybe you should go and help her?
Amy: No, it's okay. I trust Mia will do the right thing!
miia: Oh no. The smell of those skewers is making me drool... I need to get out of here quick—
Butcher: Going on an errand all alone? What a fine lass you are! How about a special discount, just for you?
miia: N-no... I have to buy some fish...
miia: But that smoke lizard looks so tasty...\n
miia: Was I supposed to buy fish...and meat?
Butcher: Oh, you need to buy meat, too? That's perfect! I'll give you a good deal on that, too.
miia: Okay! Smoke lizard meat, please!
kazuma: It's not okay! Your job is to get fish, not meat!
Amy: Oh, dear. I guess she was tempted by the delicious food right in front of her.
kazuma: What's the plan, Amy? If you don't do anything, Mia will go home with smoke lizard meat.
Amy: That silly Mia. She's always so hungry.
kazuma: Whoa! Look, she's got her purse out! We have to stop her...
Amy: Hold on, she hasn't bought it yet. I'll believe in Mia until the very—
Butcher: Thanks for your business!
kazuma: Aaah! Look where your faith got you! She failed!
Amy: That wasn't a failure. Mia bought what she wanted.\n
Amy: I'd call that a great success!
kazuma: Hey, that's not how errands work!
Amy: Don't worry about it. I wanted Mia to buy whatever she felt like eating.
kazuma: I think you're missing the point here.
miia: Oh? I thought I recognized those voices. Amy, Kazuma, what are you doing here?
Amy: U-um... We were just talking about you, Mia. Did you finish your errand?
miia: Yep! Check it out. Smoke lizard meat!
Amy: Wow! Way to go, Mia. You did a really good job.
miia: They were skewered, and just smelled so amazing! The shopkeeper said they're really delicious!
Amy: Oh Mia, you've got such great taste in food. I could never take a chance like that myself.
Amy: We'll have smoke lizard skewers tonight, then.
miia: Yay! Skewers! Skewers!
kazuma: What's with the celebration? They're acting like this errand 
kazuma: was a huge success, but it was a total failure.
kazuma: Could it be that Amy spoiling Mia is actually worse than Mia being such a troublemaker?
Amy: C'mon, Mia. Say goodbye to Kazuma.
miia: Buh-bye, Kazuma!
kazuma: Y-yeah. See you later.
Amy: I had such a great time today. I wonder if Kazuma saw just how cute Mia can be...
ナレーション: That evening, Amy was pleased to see Mia happily biting into some delicious smoke lizard skewers.
