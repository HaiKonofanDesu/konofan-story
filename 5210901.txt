Vanir Joins the Battle! Masked Demon
banil: Vanir's Death Ray!
Murder Bear: Raaaaaagh!
kazuma: Way to go! You absolutely murdered that murder bear.
aqua: Hmph! I'll have you know I'm still against 
aqua: enlisting the aid of such hellspawn.
megumin: Aw, come on, Aqua. He's on our side. And boy is it ever paying off for us.
darkness: It's not often Vanir volunteers his service like this.
banil: You helped me stock the store. It's only fair I do something in return. 
banil: Though a demon, I have a sense of values.
kazuma: Great to hear. It would also be great if we could do this again from time to time.
kazuma: It's hard to keep a store afloat. The extra income from these quest rewards is bound to help, right?
banil: Well when you put it like that, perhaps. I do, however, have one condition.
banil: I'd like you to announce how you plan to spend today's reward money. 
banil: Right here and now.
kazuma: S-Say what? 
darkness: Is that all? 
darkness: Sounds like a good deal to me, eh Kazuma? He's practically part of our party now.
kazuma: Y-Yeah?
kazuma: Crap! 
kazuma: I have an appointment 
kazuma: at the succubus shop tonight! 
kazuma: I can't just say that out loud!
megumin: What's wrong, Kazuma? 
megumin: I'm sure you only have the purest of plans...right?
kazuma: A-A paragon of purity. That's me, all right!
banil: Your pure heart appears to be hidden beneath a rather conflicted expression.
kazuma: You know, don't you?! That's why you're doing this!
banil: What I know is irrelevant. If you wish to gain my services, speak. This arrangement is quite simple.
banil: And no deceit. That wouldn't be gentlemanly, now would it?
kazuma: AAAAAAAAAGH!!! I CAN'T! I JUST CAAAAAAAAAN'T!!!
aqua: Kazuma?! Where're you going?!
banil: Mwahahahaha! The inner turmoil! The despair! 
banil: Never was there nectar so sweet!
