Valentine Episode (2023) 
komekko_valentine: Today's gonna be one for the books. All-you-can-eat chocolate! 
komekko_valentine: *Drool* 
lean_valentine: Eating chocolate is just half of the joy of Valentine's, Komekko. 
lean_valentine: The other half is giving it to others. 
darkness_valentine: What a Kommeko-esque moment. 
darkness_valentine: From the looks of things, it'll be a while before she thinks about giving chocolate to her love.
erica_valentine: And when she does, she'll have a jealous Megumin to deal with. 
erica_valentine: Who's yours for, Darkness? Kazuma? 
darkness_valentine: Yes. As a fellow party member, I owe him so much. This is an unshakable sign of my heartfelt...gratitude. 
darkness_valentine: Yeah. That's it. 
lean_valentine: Is it though? At the end there, your gaze wandered. 
lean_valentine: Could it be, Darkness? Do you have feelings forâ€” 
darkness_valentine: Wh-Wh-What lunacy are you suggesting, Rin? 
darkness_valentine: Kazuma's just a friend, nothing more. Er, uh... 
lean_valentine: Hehe, someone's nervous. 
erica_valentine: What about you, Rin? 
lean_valentine: I've got some for both Keith and Taylor. 
lean_valentine: And...Dust, too, I guess. 
lean_valentine: They are friends, after all. 
komekko_valentine: Your cookies look so munchable, Rin! 
komekko_valentine: *Drool*
lean_valentine: Hey! Not the cookies! They're for Dust. 
lean_valentine: I've got some spares over there you can eat. 
komekko_valentine: *Munch munch* 
komekko_valentine: So good! So tasty! So perfect! 
erica_valentine: I've got some extras too, Komekko. 
erica_valentine: Why don't you give them to Megumin? It would make her day. 
komekko_valentine: Thanks a bunch, Erika. 
lean_valentine: How about a quick rehearsal, then? 
lean_valentine: Chocolates at the ready, and... 
Everyone: Happy Valentine's Day!
