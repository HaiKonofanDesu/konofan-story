Beautiful Waitress
ナレーション: Megumin arrived at the Order of Axis's cafe to help earn enough money to repair the church roof...
megumin_waitress: Cecily, I'm finished changing. Would you check to make sure my bow in the back looks—
cecily_waitress: S-S-S-So...!
megumin_waitress: ...So?
cecily_waitress: So cute! How can you be so cute?! 
cecily_waitress: It's absolutely amazing! 
cecily_waitress: Just what I'd expect from the Order of Axis's new mascot!
megumin_waitress: I'd prefer not to be your mascot, thank you kindly. Actually, I'm not a member of the Order of Axis at all.
cecily_waitress: Don't sweat the details! What's important is that you really look wonderful in that uniform!
megumin_waitress: ...Thank you. Still, it's a bit strange to be wearing something so different from what I usually wear.
cecily_waitress: If that's bothering you, I know the perfect way to get used to it. Want to hear? Lean in close!
cecily_waitress: All you have to do is ditch that humdrum robe you usually wear and 
cecily_waitress: put this on. Every...single...day!
megumin_waitress: Ah! Why are you blowing in my ear?!
cecily_waitress: Your reactions are the cutest! I could watch them all day long and never get tired.
megumin_waitress: Do you really have to come on so strongly all the time?
megumin_waitress: Besides, I can't get rid of my robes. 
megumin_waitress: I'm the foremost spellcaster of the Crimson Demon Clan!
cecily_waitress: The foremost spellcaster of the Crimson Demons, indeed! Ah, you're so cute I could just eat you up.
megumin_waitress: You really are in your own little world, huh? Try to focus on your church, huh? Which will fall into ruin if we don't get the money to repair it?
megumin_waitress: That's why I'm here, after all. Let's get to work already.
cecily_waitress: Oh, Megumin... Why are you going to all this trouble...?
cecily_waitress: Oh my! I get it! You've fallen for me, haven't you?!
megumin_waitress: Absolutely not.
cecily_waitress: This always happens! People around me are simply unable to resist my charm! 
cecily_waitress: I promise, I don't do it on purpose!
megumin_waitress: That's not what's happened. ...Cecily? Are you even listening to me?
cecily_waitress: Oh, I'm such a sinful woman! Lady Aqua, why did you curse me with this otherworldly beauty?!
megumin_waitress: Will you snap out of it already?
megumin_waitress: I only wanted to help so I could repay what the Order did for me back in Arcanretia.
cecily_waitress: Oh, that's right. It's very sweet of you to remember something from so long ago.
cecily_waitress: Megumin, how would you like to get dinner after work today? We can wear our uniforms out together!
megumin_waitress: No way. That would be way too embarrassing. Although...
megumin_waitress: I'm not opposed to getting dinner.
cecily_waitress: Great! And we can go back to my place after! I have some moisturizer that I think you'll love; your skin is always so dry after all those explosions. 
cecily_waitress: I'll even spread it on for you!
megumin_waitress: Hehe... You don't ever change, do you...?
megumin_waitress: It's almost time to open. I'll flip the door sign.
megumin_waitress: Welcome!
cecily_waitress: Good morning! The Order of Axis is accepting any and all applicants! 
cecily_waitress: How about it?!
