Starry Arabian Nights
ナレーション: Invited to perform at a desert festival, Amy was hard at work practicing with her dance partner, Cielo.
Amy_arabian: Phew...
Amy_arabian: How was that?
cielo_arabian: You're doing wonderfully, Amy! You've already mastered
cielo_arabian: all the choreography!
Amy_arabian: Thank you. We only have a few more days to practice,
Amy_arabian: so I want to be prepared.
Amy_arabian: Sharing a stage with someone as cute as you is a big responsibility, after all. I don't want to let you down.
cielo_arabian: N-No, you're much cuter than me...
cielo_arabian: Which reminds me, where did you get these outfits?
Amy_arabian: Aren't they lovely? Kazuma gave them to me
Amy_arabian: when I mentioned that we'd be dancing.
Amy_arabian: They're quite different from what we wear in Samuidoh.
Amy_arabian: I think they're perfect for our performance. Shall we get back to work?
cielo_arabian: Right! We don't have a moment to lose!
cielo_arabian: You want everyone from Samuidoh to have a great time, right? I promise,
cielo_arabian: we'll make sure that happens!
cielo_arabian: The most important part of dancing is endurance! If your body
cielo_arabian: isn't strong enough to keep dancing, your moves will become sloppy!
Amy_arabian: Cielo sure is passionate about this. Perhaps she's more
Amy_arabian: of an athlete than I thought...
cielo_arabian: So, let's get started with some marathon training.
Amy_arabian: R-Right now? Can we really improve my endurance
Amy_arabian: before the festival starts?
cielo_arabian: No arguing! You asked for my help to prepare, and I'm
cielo_arabian: going to make sure we put on a star performance!
cielo_arabian: We'll start light, though. Let's say...ten laps around the lake! Ready, go!
Amy_arabian: Wh-What? I think I misheard you. Would you mind
Amy_arabian: repeating the last thing you said?
cielo_arabian: Fifteen laps around the lake!
cielo_arabian: On your mark!
Amy_arabian: Oh, dear... Don't you think that's a bit much?
Amy_arabian: Could we reduce the number just a little bit?
cielo_arabian: You're arguing again?
cielo_arabian: Twenty laps it is! Or do you want more?
Amy_arabian: Eeek!
cielo_arabian: After that, we'll move on to squats, push-ups, and crunches!
cielo_arabian: Let's go! The sooner we start, the sooner we'll finish!
Amy_arabian: There's no way I can do all that...
cielo_arabian: Of course you can, Amy!
cielo_arabian: It's all about willpower!
Amy_arabian: I'm going to be so sore tomorrow... But if it makes Mia and the other villagers smile,
Amy_arabian: it'll be worth it!
ナレーション: Amy's hard work paid off, and Mia and the other villagers of Samuidoh were amazed by her performance, allowing her a well-deserved break...
