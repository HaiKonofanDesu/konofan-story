A Present on This Holy Night! P4
megumin_christmas: Kazuma. It sounds as if you have no idea what a reindeer is.
kazuma: Apparently not. Go on, then.
ynyn_christmas: Reindeer are said to be the most monstrous of winter beasts. They're incredibly dangerous.
kazuma: Of course they are. Continue.
megumin_christmas: Their most powerful weapon is their antlers. I've heard they can even tear right through adamantite armor.
darkness_christmas: You're saying they could rip these simple clothes of ours to shreds? 
darkness_christmas: Ah, I can barely contain myself!
aqua: Wait! Why are we talking like we've already agreed to go along with this masked demon's plan?! I won't have it!
aqua: Taking on a bunch of reindeer just so you can pretend to be Santa for Christmas?! The risks don't match the reward!
kazuma: Hmm... The more I hear, the more dangerous it sounds. I think Aqua might actually have a good point this time.
megumin_christmas: No, we're definitely doing this! I am going to capture some reindeer for Komekko!
megumin_christmas: Kazuma, you said so yourself! The real Santa is supposed to ride in on a sleigh with reindeer, right?!
megumin_christmas: I refuse to let my little sister's very first Santa to be a fraud!
kazuma: This isn't about being real or fake. The danger is tooâ€”
megumin_christmas: There is no need to worry! Vanir is going to accompany us, isn't that right?
banil_christmas: But of course. You may rest easy knowing you are in the company of someone who outclasses 
banil_christmas: the Devil King himself!
darkness_christmas: Megumin sounds even more motivated than usual.
kazuma: She just wants to show off for her little sister.
megumin_christmas: And while we're at it, Yunyun gets a chance to lend a helping hand to a friend.
ynyn_christmas: Megumin, am I just an afterthought?!
ynyn_christmas: Wait, did you just say friend? 
ynyn_christmas: You did, didn't you?!
megumin_christmas: I'm not sure. Who's to say?
ynyn_christmas: You did! 
ynyn_christmas: Would you say it again?
megumin_christmas: Absolutely not.
ynyn_christmas: Oh, come on!
aqua: All right, fine! Have it your way! 
aqua: Staying behind by myself would be boring, so I'll go with you!
darkness_christmas: It's a bit cold outside... 
darkness_christmas: Which is great! Besides, Santa wouldn't complain! Remember, this is all for the children!
megumin_christmas: Look over there, Kazuma. It's a group of snow sprites.
kazuma_winter: What are you doing?! Don't point at them! What if they come this way?!
ynyn_christmas: Kazuma, there's no need to be so afraid of snow sprites. 
ynyn_christmas: As long as you leave them alone, they're harmless.
darkness_christmas: Well, the Winter Shogun struck him down once... I think the experience left him a bit traumatized.
banil_christmas: Oh, no! It's the Winter Shogun!
kazuma_winter: Ahhhhhh! 
kazuma_winter: I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I swear I didn't do anything this time! Just please don't hurt meeeeee!
banil_christmas: Oh, my apologies. It must have been my imagination.
kazuma_winter: Y-You... 
kazuma_winter: You did that on purpose, didn't you!
banil_christmas: Your animosity...
banil_christmas: is delicious! 
banil_christmas: Mwahahaha!
aqua_winter: I can't take it! It's freezing and this demon is driving me crazy! 
aqua_winter: I want to go home where it's warm and drink bubbly!
darkness_christmas: Oh, don't be that way, Aqua. We've come too far to turn back now. 
darkness_christmas: Let's see this through to the end.
kazuma_winter: How high do we have to climb, anyway? 
kazuma_winter: "They live high up on snow-covered mountains" is a bit vague.
aqua_winter: These things are supposed to be the most monstrous of the winter beasts, right?
aqua_winter: So even if we manage to catch some, how exactly do you plan to make them pull a sleigh?
ynyn_christmas: I've heard they're absolutely ferocious. Do you think that they'll really do what you ask?
banil_christmas: Worry not. That will be no problem at all. It's a secret known only to a special few, but reindeer have an interesting peculiarity. 
banil_christmas: It seems that they will never disobey anyone who is able to best them in battle.
banil_christmas: Therefore, once I inevitably demonstrate my superior strength, they will show absolute obedience.
darkness_christmas: Absolute...
darkness_christmas: obedience...?!
kazuma_winter: Does that excite you?
darkness_christmas: Of course not!
