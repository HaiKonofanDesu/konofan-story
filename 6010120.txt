God's Blessing on Aqua's Birthday! (2022)
aqua: Who dared allow this goddess's glass to run dry? 
aqua: I demand more bubbly! 
ynyn: R-Right away, Honorable Goddess!
aqua: You too, Wiz. These shoulders aren't going to massage themselves. 
wiz: I'm so sorry! I'll do better!
Amy: If you get tired, I can take over for you. 
Amy: I'm pretty good at giving massages.
miia: Lady Aqua! I brought some treats that'll pair perfectly with your bubbly!
melissa: And I brought this for you! 
melissa: A blue gem as beautiful as you are, Lady Aqua.
aqua: Oh! You two shouldn't have! 
aqua: But since you already did, I'll gladly accept your gifts! 
aqua: Now keep the praise and adoration coming!
kazuma: What's all this? People actually believe Aqua's a goddess?
darkness: Oh, not at all. 
darkness: But today is Aqua's birthday.
megumin: So everyone got together and decided to celebrate by making her Goddess for a Day!
kazuma: That explains all the groveling...and why she's so full of herself.
aqua: Kazuma? What are you guys whispering about?\n
aqua: Come here! We just got more bubbly! It's time for a toast!
kazuma: Ugh. She's getting on my nerves already. Do we have to do this?
megumin: Yes. Now be nice. We all agreed to do whatever she wanted. Besides, it's only for one day.
darkness: I like it. It's nice to see Aqua so confident. She's very domineering when she give orders. 
darkness: Hehehe...
kazuma: ...Fine. I guess I can deal with it for one day.
aqua: What's the hold up, Kazuma?! 
aqua: Hurry up already!
kazuma: Coming!
Everyone: Happy birthday! Cheers!
