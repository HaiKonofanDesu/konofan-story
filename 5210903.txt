Hear My Voice! Showtime
mel_stage: La lalala... ♪ 
mel_stage: This should get their attention! Oh, but this pose might be good too.
squall: Mel, why are you posing in front of the mirror?
mel_stage: Isn't it obvious? I'm getting ready for my next show!
squall: Before you've been asked to perform? 
squall: You must really love putting on shows.
mel_stage: I do! There's no better way to get every eye on me. 
mel_stage: I'm sure to make lots of new friends! 
mel_stage: Plus, look at this outfit! You can't deny that it looks great on me!
squall: I don't know much about dancers, but your outfit does seem to suite you.
mel_stage: What a roundabout answer! 
mel_stage: Erika says it's always better to just give an honest compliment, like "You look cute." 
mel_stage: I can't wait to get on stage with Lia and the others!
squall: Try not to cause any trouble for Axel Hearts, okay?
mel_stage: Hmph. You always say that, Squall! 
mel_stage: Don't worry, I only have a few small surprises in store. 
mel_stage: I got a scary mask to frighten the group backstage and some paint to throw on the fans when the show starts!
squall: So that's why there was paint strewn around the sitting room. I already disposed of it.
mel_stage: What?! That was mean! 
mel_stage: Please don't meddle with my plans!
squall: Don't be ridiculous. It's my duty to keep an eye on you. 
squall: I'm trying not to be too strict, but...
squall: I'll repeat myself. Don't cause trouble, alright?
mel_stage: Sheesh! You're such a worrywart, Squall! 
mel_stage: I can forget about the paint, but I'm taking the mask!
mel_stage: And some super spicy drinks and some toy snakes to use as streamers and some electrified rods to replace the glow sticks and...
squall: The mask is enough! 
squall: *Sigh* I wonder how the show will turn out...
ナレーション: Mel's lack of restraint left Squall constantly on his guard.
