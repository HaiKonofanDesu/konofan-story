megumin: I'm surprised you decided to join us on a quest, Wiz.
wiz: Well, you guys are always helping me out...
So I thought I'd try to return the favor.
darkness: You were a powerful adventurer once.
It's fortuitous that you would choose to join us.
megumin: Anyway, where are those dire bunnies?!
We've been searching all day and haven't seen a single one!
wiz: Oh! I think I can help... I brought the perfect magic item for just such an occasion. Let's give it a shot!
kazuma: I have a bad feeling about what Wiz considers to be 
kazuma: the "perfect magic item."
aqua: Hold on. Is this really the best idea?
Wiz's items aren't exactly known for being helpful.
kazuma: Hey, don't jinx it!
wiz: Hop, hop!
kazuma: ...Wiz, why are you wearing those bunny ears?
wiz: Aren't they adorable?
kazuma: Yeah, sure, but...why?
wiz: They're not your everyday bunny ears. Hehe...
wiz: Wearing them makes bunnies think you're friendly.
They'll be hopping this way in no time!
Dire Bunny A: *Hop hop*
darkness: Look! A fluffle of killer bunnies! Did Wiz's item truly attract them?
Dire Bunny B: *Hop hop* *Hop hop*
megumin: They just keep coming! Those ears must be working!
kazuma: Huh. I guess those things might actually be useful during this quest.
wiz: That's exactly why I brought them!
I knew they'd come in handy.
Giant Dire Bunny: *Hop hop* *Hop hop*
megumin: Uh... Isn't that one kinda big? 
megumin: There's something weird about it...
Dire Bunnies: *Hop hop* *Hooooooppp*
aqua: Whoa! The dire bunnies are gathering around Wiz!
Wiz? Wiz?!
wiz: Eek! 
wiz: Aaaugh!\n
wiz: Wh-Why are you attacking me?! I'm your friend!
wiz: Stop it! Your horns are poking meâ€”! 
wiz: Yow!
kazuma: You okay, Wiz?!
darkness: She's buried beneath an entire colony of killer bunnies!\n
darkness: A-Actually... That looks quite...enjoyable. 
darkness: Have at me, bunnies!
kazuma: This isn't the time for that! We've gotta help her!
