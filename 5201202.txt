Lovely Hot Spring
ynyn_towel: I'm finally at the Arcanretia hot springs! I've wanted to 
ynyn_towel: visit ever since Megumin bragged about coming here.
ynyn_towel: *Sigh* It feels like the pains of life are dissolving away...
dust_towel: Is that Yunyun I hear?
ynyn_towel: Yes, it's... 
ynyn_towel: Wh-Whaaat?! Is that you, Dust?! Where are you?!
dust_towel: I thought it was you. The guy's bath is on the other side of the fence. You here to take a load off too?
ynyn_towel: W-Well, yes...
dust_towel: Two people on a journey of rest and relaxation! Fate must've brought us together. Let's have some fun!
ynyn_towel: Some fun? 
ynyn_towel: Like, get dinner after this or something?
dust_towel: Not a bad idea, but have you ever heard of deepening your friendships by laying everything bare?
dust_towel: A special bond is formed when people communicate without holding anything back! 
dust_towel: It helps them become the dearest friends!
dust_towel: What do you say we deepen our friendship, Yunyun?! 
dust_towel: Nothing comes between true friends, not even fences!
ynyn_towel: Don't you dare use me as an excuse to enter the women's bath! Lightning!
dust_towel: AAA
dust_towel: AAARRRGGGHHH!!!
dust_towel: J-Just a little setback! But I won't give up on our friendship, Yunyun! 
dust_towel: Just one peek, and we'll be closer thanâ€”
ynyn_towel: Absolutely not! Cursed Lightning!!!
dust_towel: AAA
dust_towel: AAARRRGGGHHH!!!
ynyn_towel: *Sigh* A hot spring is supposed to be relaxing, but now I'm 
ynyn_towel: worn out. I really don't need that kind of friend.
ynyn_towel: Next time I'll ask Megumin to join me instead.
