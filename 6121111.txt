A Plan for This Master of Death P1
shalltear: Grrrrrrngh!
albedo: I shall bear this no longer!
hamusuke: Hey, you two! Calm down!
ainz: What is the meaning of this ruckus?
kazuma: I take it Shalltear and Albedo are at it again?
albedo: On the contrary, we are of the same mind on this matter. 
albedo: After all, it pertains to Lord Ainz!
ainz: Oh?
shalltear: The townsfolk dare refer to a Supreme Being with such base slander as "skull creature" and "abomination"! 
shalltear: What gall!
kazuma: So that's what this is all about. 
kazuma: You know, seeing Ainz for the first time spooked me too. Don't take it person—
albedo: Personally?! How else can one take such brazen disrespect? 
albedo: Lord Ainz, allow me to rain sweet death upon the offenders!
ainz: I shall allow no such thing. Kazuma requested we stay out of trouble until we return to our world.
albedo: B-But my lord...I only wish for these simpletons to know 
albedo: your sheer magnificence.
shalltear: If not with death, allow us to teach show your splendor with words!
ainz: Huh? Splendor?
hamusuke: A fine idea, that! I'll help too!
ainz: Wait a second. What exactly—
albedo: By all means, please wait here and lift not one finger, my liege. 
albedo: I beseech you.
ainz: No, that's not what I—
shalltear: Shall we be off then...big-mouthed gorilla?
albedo: Excuse me...?! 
albedo: Stop right there, you slimy little eel!
ainz: Well...there they go.
kazuma: This is no time stand and gawk! 
kazuma: *Sigh* They're bound to cause trouble. 
kazuma: We'd best follow them.
ainz: Thanks. You're too kind.
kazuma: In their defense, they have good intentions. I guess being popular's not always easy, huh?
ainz: I would rather they express their good intentions by staying put. 
ainz: Oh well, maybe they just can't help themselves.
ナレーション: So began Albedo and Shalltear's plot to make Ainz's name resound throughout the land...
