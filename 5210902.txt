Manic Mansion! Maid
ナレーション: It was flu season and servants at the Dustiness estate had succumbed to sickness, spurring Kazuma and Lia to offer their services.
lia_maid: There. The laundry is all hanged. 
lia_maid: And with today's clear weather, it shouldn't take long to dry.
kazuma_maid: Wow, you just washed and hanged ALL the dirty laundry in the mansion. 
kazuma_maid: I didn't know you had such talents.
lia_maid: Hey, I'm a little hurt. 
lia_maid: I wash Cielo and Erika's costumes all the time. Even cook. All in a day's work, really.
kazuma_maid: Now it's coming together. 
kazuma_maid: So you can do everything BUT clean. Your room, specifically.
lia_maid: H-Hey, that's not fair... 
lia_maid: Not everyone can be good at everything, okay?
darkness: Ah, so you were here in the courtyard. It's almost time for afternoon tea. Is everything prepared?
lia_maid: Oh, Darkness— 
lia_maid: Ahem. I mean, my how time flies, Lady Lalatina. 
lia_maid: But of course.
darkness: D-D-Don't call me that, please! I much prefer Darkness!
lia_maid: Though only a temporary arrangement, as a servant of this estate, I cannot refer to its heir in such a casual manner.
darkness: Ugh! How did you even find out?! Did someone put you up to this?
kazuma_maid: Calm yourself. Such accusations are not befitting of you, 
kazuma_maid: my sweet and noble Lady Lalatina.
darkness: I knew it! Kazuma, you cur!
lia_maid: Kazuma? Is this really how Darkness wants to be addressed? Her reaction suggests otherwise...
kazuma_maid: Her joy is so strong, it's overflowing. Every noble wants to be reminded of their status from time to time. 
kazuma_maid: Right, Lady Lalatina?
darkness: Argh! Kazuma, 
darkness: you sick, sadistic...!
kazuma_maid: P-Please unhand me, Lady Lalatina! 
kazuma_maid: Even in jest, it is not befitting someone of your stature to—
Kazuma, Darkness: Aaahhh!
lia_maid: H-Hey, are you two okay?!
kazuma_maid: L-Lady Lalatina. You're not hurt, I hope?
darkness: No, thanks to you. But please—do not utter that name again.
kazuma_maid: M'lady. You would take advantage of me, your loyal servant? 
kazuma_maid: And in broad daylight, no less? Very well. Shall we proceed, then?
darkness: Wh-Wh-What are you babbling on about?!
kazuma_maid: Though my master, you are still human, and have human urges. 
kazuma_maid: Sate them, m'lady. Sate them!
darkness: You twisted degenerate! Shut your mouth! Shut it, I say!
lia_maid: *Sigh* Kazuma said he wanted to be there for Darkness in her time of need. 
lia_maid: I see now that he only wanted to ridicule her.
