Legendary Adventurer Festival
chris_fest: According to the map, the Legendary Adventurer's treasure is just up ahead. 
chris_fest: C'mon, let's hop to it! 
kazuma_fest: Chris is in high spirits. 
kazuma_fest: And thanks to her thieving skills, these tough dungeons are a cakewalk.
darkness_fest: Her combat skills don't fall short either, that last monster couldn't land a single hit. 
darkness_fest: She inspires me to train harder in my duties! 
chris_fest: Hehe. I feel light as a feather in this outfit. 
chris_fest: Like I can dodge anything and everything!
megumin_fest: It looks great AND is functional? Those are some serious threads! 
megumin_fest: It gets a 10/10 on the 
megumin_fest: Crimson Demon scale!
aqua_fest: Maybe now you can keep your panties safe from Kazuma's Steal skill. 
chris_fest: Don't remind me of the bad times, please. 
chris_fest: And that BETTER not give you any ideas! I'm warning you! 
kazuma_fest: Don't worry. I wouldn't dream of it. 
kazuma_fest: I just need to set the record straight that I'm not TRYING to steal your panties. I can't control the skill, okay? 
chris_fest: I mean, I guess... 
chris_fest: Hm?
chris_fest: Stay alert! Something's coming! 
Skeletons: Rrrrrrrrrgh!
darkness_fest: Skeletons! 
darkness_fest: That's quite a handful of them, too. 
kazuma_fest: But, oh dear! Why are there so many?! 
kazuma_fest: Just kidding. 
kazuma_fest: We all know Aqua lured them here. 
kazuma_fest: Wow. I'm so absolutely thrilled to have her on our team. 
aqua_fest: Hey! If you're so unhappy about it, find someone else to heal you! You bully! 
Skeletons: Rrrrrrrrrgh!
chris_fest: It doesn't matter why, they're almost here! Get ready! 
chris_fest: Haaah!
Skeletons: Wrrrrrrnnngh...!
darkness_fest: You're too fast for us to see! You're really on a roll today. 
darkness_fest: Aqua, Kazuma, let's back her up!
aqua_fest: It's a goddess' time to shine! Turn Undead! 
kazuma_fest: They're just a pile of bones without their weapons! 
kazuma_fest: Gimme those swords! Steal! 
Skeleton: Waaaaaargh! 
chris_fest: You're mine! Hah!
kazuma_fest: Wait, Chris! Get outta the way or—
kazuma_fest: Huh? This article of cloth... 
kazuma_fest: Can it be?
chris_fest: Grr...
kazuma_fest: I guess it can be. 
chris_fest: HOW?! WHY? EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 
chris_fest: GIVE ME BACK MY P-PANTIES!!!
ナレーション: Though the gang went on to dispatch the skeletons and obtain the treasure, Chris' high spirits never returned...
