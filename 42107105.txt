Treasure Hunting on This Summer Vacation! - P5
ナレーション: "On the night of the full moon shall appear the land where the treasure sleepeth."
ナレーション: Kazuma and friends quickly swam the the mysterious treasure island that appeared offshore.
arue_swimwear: And so, our heroes tread upon the mysterious isle...where 
arue_swimwear: unknown terrors await! A classic premise, but a good one!
darkness_swimwear: How can a map refer to a previously nonexistent island? It's rather surreal.
kazuma_swimwear: While we have the luxury of the full moon's light, all I can see here are big grey boulders. 
kazuma_swimwear: Where's the treasure?
aqua_swimwear: Don't you have a treasure detection skill?
kazuma_swimwear: Yes, and I've been using it. But it hasn't turned up 
kazuma_swimwear: anything significant. 
kazuma_swimwear: At least, I think.
iris_swimwear: What do you mean?
kazuma_swimwear: There's treasure somewhere around here, but I can't get a good directional reading.
komekko_swimwear: True treasure can't be found with some skill! Step aside and I'll prove it!
megumin_swimwear: Well said, Komekko! 
megumin_swimwear: It is not skills that will lead us to the treasure, but our very souls!
arue_swimwear: We shall soon claim this hidden fortune. I swear, upon my honor as a Crimson Demon!
ナレーション: One hour later...
kazuma_swimwear: Find anything yet?
darkness_swimwear: Nothing remotely resembling treasure this way.
megumin_swimwear: Same here!
arue_swimwear: Not even my mighty eye of crimson, concealed behind this eyepatch, could detect the treasure's whereabouts...
aqua_swimwear: Well, we've searched the entire island up and down. You think the map is wrong? 
clair: Or perhaps some miscreant has already claimed the treasure. 
iris_swimwear: That's a possibility. The map is rather old. 
iris_swimwear: Having come all this way, I hoped we would find something... *sniff*
arue_swimwear: But we have, Princess. And a magnificent treasure it is.
iris_swimwear: Huh?
arue_swimwear: The time we spent together— 
arue_swimwear: that's the true treasure lying right under our noses all this time.
iris_swimwear: Oh my!
arue_swimwear: Heh. I see we are in agreement.
kazuma_swimwear: D-
kazuma_swimwear: Darn straight!
kazuma_swimwear: A pretty nimble recovery. I wouldn't have expected a Crimson Demon to go that route. 
kazuma_swimwear: Good thinking, Arue.
megumin_swimwear: Shall we head back, then?
iris_swimwear: Yes, let's. 
iris_swimwear: Thank you all for humoring my whims with this—
komekko_swimwear: Whazzat?!
darkness_swimwear: What's what, Komekko?
komekko_swimwear: Over there.
megumin_swimwear: It looks like... 
megumin_swimwear: something's shining?
kazuma_swimwear: Yes, with a particularly golden gleam. 
kazuma_swimwear: Do you think? Could it be?!
aqua_swimwear: Yep, looks like gold to me! How many bottles of 
aqua_swimwear: bubbly do you think this could buy?
darkness_swimwear: While it is strange that it's growing 
darkness_swimwear: out of the ground, I suppose it is gold. 
komekko_swimwear: Oh yeah, we're loaded for life! Mom and Dad'll keel over when they find out we're filthy stinkin' rich!
megumin_swimwear: F-Filthy stinking rich...? Komekko, that's not really an age-appropriate 
megumin_swimwear: expression...
kazuma_swimwear: She's calling it like it is. And personally, I like the idea 
kazuma_swimwear: of being so rich it's filthy! Now to dig out this gold...
clair: With what? We don't have a single shovel between us.
kazuma_swimwear: Don't need one... 
kazuma_swimwear: Not when you're the brains of this group! Bind!
iris_swimwear: Ah, I see! To haul out the treasure, we need only pull on 
iris_swimwear: the end of this rope!
kazuma_swimwear: Exactly. 
kazuma_swimwear: Everyone, grab on the rope and 
kazuma_swimwear: one...two...PULL!
Everyone: Mrrrmmmgh!
kazuma_swimwear: And a pull! 
kazuma_swimwear: And a pull! 
kazuma_swimwear: ...Huh? Another 
kazuma_swimwear: tremor?!
？？？: Grrrgh... Mroooaaarrrgh!
kazuma_swimwear: Aaagh! 
kazuma_swimwear: The ground's tilting!
darkness_swimwear: No! The entire island itself is moving!
iris_swimwear: Quick! Swim back to the beach!
Toothed Turtle: Gwoooaaarrrngh!
arue_swimwear: The island...has a face.
megumin_swimwear: Oh... The mysterious island was the back of a Toothed Turtle.
kazuma_swimwear: The colossal monster you were talking about before, right? 
kazuma_swimwear: It's super rare and has a massive overbite?
aqua_swimwear: The very one. The mother lode of gold we found was actually 
aqua_swimwear: just its tooth.
Toothed Turtle: Gwoooaaarrrngh!
kazuma_swimwear: So, we tried a dental extraction, and now the thing's mad as heck. 
kazuma_swimwear: I'll never get used to this world...
komekko_swimwear: Mmm... Turtle soup. *Drool*
megumin_swimwear: That's the spirit, Komekko! Kazuma, this is no time to be 
megumin_swimwear: dumbfounded. We have a turtle to topple!
