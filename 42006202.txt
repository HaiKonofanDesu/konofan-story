A Suspicious Request - P2
megumin: EXPLOSION!!
ナレーション: Megumin used her explosion spell to finish off the last of the monsters in a fiery blast.
megumin: *Pant* Did you...see that?
darkness: And so it ends. They were a sorry lot.
kazuma: They weren't SUPPOSED to be here at all! But no, SOMEBODY had to take that stupid quest!
aqua: Are you still complaining about that?
aqua: All I wanted was a picnic at the hot springs!
aqua: So EXCUSE ME for trying to have a good time with all of you!
kazuma: Ah, there she goes, trying to turn it all back on us like some spoiled little princess.
megumin: Kazuma, I'm going to need you to carry me...
kazuma: Ah, fine... 
kazuma: Hey. Hey, Aqua. Come on, stop crying. We're still going to the hot springs, right?
aqua: ...The hot springs?
kazuma: Well, they didn't go away just 'cause the monsters showed up.\n
kazuma: So the picnic's still on, yeah?
aqua: ...YEAH, the picnic's still on! The good times are just getting started here!
aqua: No more monsters! Hot springs, straight ahead!
darkness: She brightened rather quickly.
kazuma: Yeah, she does that.
kazuma: Still, my gut's telling me something's off here...
aqua: Get ready for an amazing hot spring holiday!
Megumin, Darkness: Hooray!
ナレーション: They soon arrived at their destination, but as Kazuma's\nintuition had warned him, danger was still at hand.
ナレーション: Aqua's presence immediately purified the hot springs, leaving the water plain and scalding. Not as scalding as the complaints from the townsfolk, though.
