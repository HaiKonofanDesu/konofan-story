Glamorous Casino Bunny
ナレーション: In the corner of a bustling casino, a different sort of
battle was about to unfold...
cecily_casino: As a devout priestess of the Order of Axis, it is my duty to lead the lost souls here today into the light!
Casino Patron: Agh! Lost again!
cecily_casino: Excuse me, sir?
cecily_casino: You really shouldn't waste your time in front of that slot machine, giving in to your base urges by wagering money.
Casino Patron: You got a problem with my gambling?
cecily_casino: Not at all! It's simply that you are exactly the kind of person we're looking for! 
cecily_casino: You should join the Order of Axis right away!
Casino Patron: Huh? Hey! Somebody! Help! This woman is crazy!
cecily_casino: Drat! Lost another one...
？？？: I don't blame him. Anybody would run when you come on that strongly.
cecily_casino: Oh, hello! It's been a while! What brings you here?
mitsurugi_casino: Lady Aqua asked me to lend a hand. She said you might need it.
cecily_casino: Oh! A heavenly request!
mitsurugi_casino: Haha! I suppose you could say that. 
mitsurugi_casino: So... How might I be of service? If there's anything you need, I'll take care of it.
cecily_casino: Anything?
mitsurugi_casino: As long as it is within my power, yes. Anything.
cecily_casino: Mitsurugi, wielder of the magic blade... They say he's so strong he once defeated an ancient dragon.
cecily_casino: With a reputation like that, he's probably loaded. And he's willing to do anything for me. 
cecily_casino: This is practically a dream come true!
cecily_casino: In that case, let's get married!
mitsurugi_casino: Wh-What?! What are you—
cecily_casino: Yeah! I mean, what are the odds we'd meet in such an unlikely place? This is fate, I'm sure of it!
mitsurugi_casino: But Lady Aqua asked me to come here. That's not really fate, and—
cecily_casino: There's no need to be shy. 
cecily_casino: Though I do love modesty!
mitsurugi_casino: No. Please. Just calm down for a minute and listen to m—
cecily_casino: Oh! I know how we can settle this! Why don't I just give this roulette wheel here a little spin?
cecily_casino: If the ball lands on black, we'll stay friends. 
cecily_casino: But! If it lands on red...
cecily_casino: I'll accept your marriage proposal!
mitsurugi_casino: Wait, what?! I didn't propose to you!
cecily_casino: Ready?! Here goes!
mitsurugi_casino: Hold on a minute—
cecily_casino: Destiny has spoken! The ball landed on...
cecily_casino: Red! Marriage it is! I'm all yours to love and pamper forever!
mitsurugi_casino: No! What is wrong with you?! You're not listening to a single word I say! 
mitsurugi_casino: I'm getting outta here!
cecily_casino: Wait! Don't go yet!
cecily_casino: This will only take a moment! I just need one quick signature! 
cecily_casino: Then we're done! 
cecily_casino: I'll let you borrow my pen and everything!
mitsurugi_casino: I'm too young to get married! I don't even know you!
ナレーション: With a mighty shout, Mitsurugi turned on his heel and fled. Poor Cecily couldn't convert a single person that day...
