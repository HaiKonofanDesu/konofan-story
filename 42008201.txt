ナレーション: Kazuma, Iris, and the others found themselves in the scorching desert...
kazuma: It's so hot... I can't take another step...
megumin: Keep moving, Kazuma, or you'll dry up. Let's at least find some shade 
megumin: before stopping.
aqua: Shade? Where are we going to find shade? We've been walking forever, and all I see is more sand.
darkness: True... 
darkness: Do you grow weary as well, Lady Iris?
iris_stealth: On the contrary. I've never been to a desert before. Seeing such new and amazing sights is an absolute treat!
iris_stealth: I must apologize, however. You're only here because I said I wanted to see the desert.
kazuma: Don't worry about it. We had a quest to take care of, anyways. Besides, it must be nice for you to sneak out like this.
iris_stealth: Are you sure it's all right for me to be the only one riding on a camel, though? I feel a bit bad about it.
darkness: It's perfectly fine. We could never ask you to walk in such a place. Please worry not about us.
megumin: I've never seen a camel before. Those humps on its back are so strange... Is something inside them?
kazuma: They're full of fat. Camels store any extra energy they can to survive in this harsh environment.
iris_stealth: Really? How interesting! You are quite knowledgeable.
aqua: ...Huh? Hey, everyone! Look over there!\n
aqua: It's a giant lake!
megumin: You're right! And a big town full of life and trees!
darkness: It must be an oasis. We can stop there to get some rest.
kazuma: So...thirsty... Need...water... 
kazuma: Let's run for it!
aqua: *Huff huff* What the? Why aren't we 
aqua: getting any closer?
megumin: And now we're even more exhausted from running...
iris_stealth: Aqua? Megumin? Are you all right?
kazuma: Great... It must be a mirage.
iris_stealth: A mirage...?
darkness: It's a natural phenomenon caused by pockets of hot and cool air that bend light, making you see things on the horizon.
iris_stealth: So that oasis... 
iris_stealth: It's an illusion?
aqua: What?! But we worked so hard to reach it! I'm going to have 
aqua: words with the person responsible!
kazuma: Don't be stupid. There's nothing to be done about nature's cruel jokes. 
kazuma: God has abandoned us!
aqua: Uh, hello? Goddess, here! You know how insulting that is?
kazuma: Yeah, whatever. Man, I'm thirsty. Everyone, get out your canteens. 
kazuma: Create Water!
aqua: Whew... I needed that!
iris_stealth: I never knew water could taste so wonderful. 
iris_stealth: What a marvelous experience all around!
iris_stealth: We even saw a natural phenomenon. I'm so glad we came. 
iris_stealth: I just wish I could grow up faster to experience more.
darkness: Your way of finding the good in everything purifies the 
darkness: spirit. It gives me renewed strength!
kazuma: All right, let's rest for just a few more minutes. It'd be good if we could get there by dark.
？？？: Guuuhhh...
aqua: Huh? Did you guys hear that?
Troll Warrior: Graaah! Hot! Too hot!
kazuma: Aaah! A t-troll?!
iris_stealth: Do you think it's one of Daniel's soldiers?
darkness: Stand back, Lady Iris! We'll handle this.
iris_stealth: No! I'll fight too, Lalatina!
darkness: B-But...
kazuma: Once Iris makes up her mind, there's no changing it.
kazuma: \nOkay team, it's go time!
iris_stealth: Yeah! So let's do this!
