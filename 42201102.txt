A Little Luck for This New Year! - P2 
kazuma_newyear: Wow. You look amazing! 
iris_newyear: O-Oh come now. You exaggerate too much. 
darkness_newyear: Not in the slightest. It looks fabulous on you. 
megumin_newyear: It's like looking at a real princess. 
kazuma_newyear: You are. She is. 
iris_newyear: Thank you everyone. Being able to wear the same attire as all of you fills me with great joy. 
aqua_newyear: Even the size is perfect. 
kazuma_newyear: And now, time for the fun. 
kazuma_newyear: I hereby call this New Year's bash into session! 
kazuma_newyear: A one, two, three, four! 
aqua_newyear: Smash that mochi 'round some more! 
iris_newyear: The two of them are in perfect sync. 
iris_newyear: Amazing! 
megumin_newyear: And they're fast to boot. They improve each year. 
darkness_newyear: I never thought I'd be so jealous of mochi, getting pounded into oblivion by a giant, restless mallet. 
darkness_newyear: Oh! Yes! 
kazuma_newyear: Hey! Stop being so distractingly masochistic! 
Townsperson A: What's this? Some kinda street performance? 
Townsperson B: No, it's Kazuma's party. They have bizarre New Year's customs, remember? That freshly pounded mochi is tasty, though. 
iris_newyear: I see the townsfolk have already tasted this delicacy. 
iris_newyear: I admit, I'm a bit jealous... 
kazuma_newyear: We'll have a batch ready right away. 
kazuma_newyear: Fancy giving the mochi a few whacks? Careful, hammers tend to be heavy. 
iris_newyear: O-Okay. 
megumin_newyear: None other than myself, Megumin, shall be the indomitable ever-turner of mochi! 
megumin_newyear: Prepare to bear witness to my unstoppable mochi-rolling technique! 
iris_newyear: Very well. Here I go... Heave-ho! 
aqua_newyear: Um, what? Did she just...break the mortar? 
darkness_newyear: Lady Iris, please! Control your strength! 
iris_newyear: M-My apologies... 
kazuma_newyear: With strength like that, no one will ever doubt your royal lineage. 
kazuma_newyear: For a sec, that hammer looked like a mighty, mochi-destroying Something-calibur. 
Townsperson A: D-Did you just see that? And didn't call her Lady Iris? 
Townsperson B: Isn't royal family super strong? Do you think that could be the Princess Iris...? 
kazuma_newyear: Uh-oh! Those bystanders are catching on to Iris's identity! 
kazuma_newyear: Thanks for watching, ladies and gents! 
kazuma_newyear: A round of applause for our master mochi-making performers, Megumin and Irene! 
megumin_newyear: Uh, performers? 
kazuma_newyear: Come on, Irene, the silk crepe seller, say something to our lovely audience, will you? 
kazuma_newyear: Will you?! 
iris_newyear: I-Irene here! My grandfather sells silk crepe just over, er, somewhere! 
iris_newyear: Happy New Year to you all! 
Townsperson A: See, it was just a street performance. No way she actually shattered that mortar like a cracker. 
Townsperson B: And just the granddaughter of a silk crepe seller? I guess people really can look exactly like someone else. 
kazuma_newyear: All right, fortunately we successfully lied to everyone. 
aqua_newyear: Well, the mortar is in pieces, but at least we have some tasty mochi! 
darkness_newyear: One hit from the princess was all it took to work the mochi to perfection. If only she'd hit me too. 
darkness_newyear: O-O-Oh my! 
kazuma_newyear: Really? Mochi? Mochi is all it takes to get you going? 
darkness_newyear: You're imagining things. 
megumin_newyear: Come on, let's dig in. 
megumin_newyear: Is there anything better than freshly-made mochi? 
iris_newyear: If I may ask, how does one go about eating it? 
kazuma_newyear: No need to overthink things. All you need are these plates and chopsticks. 
kazuma_newyear: Pour some soy sauce on top and you're good to go. 
kazuma_newyear: Well, help yourself. 
iris_newyear: *Chomp* 
iris_newyear: Hrmm? Duh mochi ish shtretching in muh mouf...! 
iris_newyear: Sho shoft! An' tayshtee! 
aqua_newyear: Right? Whether it's in New Year's soup or red bean porridge, mochi is always amazing. 
iris_newyear: So many ways to eat mochi, and they all sound delicious. 
megumin_newyear: Try it all out and see what you like. We can always make more. 
iris_newyear: Okay! Today is the day I eat as much as my stomach can bear! 
ナレーション: While Iris was engrossed in her New Year's treats, a lone figure observed the party... 
banil: Isn't that the silk crepe trader's granddaughter? Yet this aroma...it seems familiar. 
banil: Things are about to get very interesting. 
banil: Mwahahaha!
