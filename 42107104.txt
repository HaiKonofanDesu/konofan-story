Treasure Hunting on This Summer Vacation! - P4
ナレーション: The sun gave way to the dark shroud of night, adorned with a full moon...
aqua_swimwear: According to the map, the treasure appears during a full moon?
clair: Yes. If it is indeed correct, we should be witnessing a change any minute now.
arue_swimwear: Remain vigilant, my allies. For we may have already wandered into a mysterious web of illusions.
megumin_swimwear: If that is so, the time of judgment is nigh.
komekko_swimwear: And the Darkmaster shall awaken.
iris_swimwear: Illusions? Judgment? 
iris_swimwear: I'm not sure I follow, Brother. Could you explain?
kazuma_swimwear: You don't need to understand. It's the usual Crimson Demon-style nonsense.
darkness_swimwear: What's the plan, Kazuma? Stay put and observe a little while longer?
kazuma_swimwear: Yep. Adventurers don't go home empty-handed. 
kazuma_swimwear: Who's up for dinner while we wait?
aqua_swimwear: We have a hefty store of fish thanks to Komekko.
kazuma_swimwear: Komekko's survival skills are nothing to scoff at. No doubt a byproduct of her impoverished lifestyle...
arue_swimwear: With Mother Nature left alone to thrive, 
arue_swimwear: I stumbled upon a rare variety of fruit and mushrooms in the woods.
aqua_swimwear: Wow! Check out the patterns on this one! I bet it's super rare.
kazuma_swimwear: Yes, and poisonous to boot! 
kazuma_swimwear: Throw it away!
aqua_swimwear: No, that's wasteful! 
aqua_swimwear: Take a nibble and tell me if it's really poisonous. 
aqua_swimwear: I'll cure you if you double over in agony.
kazuma_swimwear: At that point, just don't cure me. 
kazuma_swimwear: ...Hm? 
kazuma_swimwear: What's that 
kazuma_swimwear: appetizing aroma?
megumin_swimwear: Komekko couldn't wait and started grilling the fish. 
darkness_swimwear: And she began the fire herself as well. She is rather impressive. 
komekko_swimwear: Keep the fish a good distance from the fire for a slow, even grill.
megumin_swimwear: This reminds me of our days in the Crimson Demon Village.
komekko_swimwear: Except today, we're feasting on REAL fish! 
komekko_swimwear: Usually, it's just cicadas and crawfish.
iris_swimwear: Cicadas? As in...insects?
megumin_swimwear: Thaaat's enough of that! 
megumin_swimwear: Komekko, keep an eye on the fish, would you? Don't wanna burn our catch!
iris_swimwear: I apologize in advance for my ignorance, but I must ask. Are insects...edible?
komekko_swimwear: Sure are. I like the bumpy ones!
iris_swimwear: B-Bumpy ones?
clair: Princess, heed not another word! 
clair: Such matters have no bearing on someone of your stature.
aqua_swimwear: Whew! What a meal to remember! 
aqua_swimwear: Nothing quite like freshly caught fish!
darkness_swimwear: And seasoned just right. 
iris_swimwear: Never could I have experienced this within the palace walls. 
iris_swimwear: Thank you all, for the best summer vacation ever.
arue_swimwear: Oh, don't thank us just yet. The real leg of our journey 
arue_swimwear: has yet to begin—treasure hunting. 
megumin_swimwear: The treasure's written to appear on the night of a full moon. 
megumin_swimwear: Here we have a full moon. Where's the trea—
komekko_swimwear: What was that? An earthquake?
aqua_swimwear: Pretty short earthquake. 
aqua_swimwear: Hey, look! In the sea!
megumin_swimwear: Is that an...island?! 
megumin_swimwear: How strange. I don't recall anything 
megumin_swimwear: there earlier.
darkness_swimwear: "On the night of the full moon 
darkness_swimwear: shall appear the LAND"...So then, quite literally, new land has appeared?
kazuma_swimwear: Seems so. 
kazuma_swimwear: Good thing we waited, eh gang?!
komekko_swimwear: The treasure's on that island!
iris_swimwear: It truly was a real treasure map! 
iris_swimwear: How thrilling!
aqua_swimwear: The real adventure starts now. 
aqua_swimwear: Is everyone ready? To swim, that is—to the island!
ナレーション: And so, Kazuma and company swam to the miniature isle of mystery...
