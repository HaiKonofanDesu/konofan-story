A New Year for This Starter Town! - P5
kazuma_newyear: Phew... How far is that lion dancer going to run? 
kazuma_newyear: It sure has a lot of stamina for a kid.
darkness_newyear: And despite being so cute, it's quite ferocious too.
megumin_newyear: It's really fast, too. 
megumin_newyear: I've completely lost sight of it.
aqua_newyear: Look, I see tracks. ...There are droppings here, too.
kazuma_newyear: Lion dancer dung? ...What goes in must come out, I guess.
aqua_newyear: Come on, we're not letting this thing get away! 
aqua_newyear: Just wait, you little mochi thief!
megumin_newyear: Look, Kazuma! There it is! The lion dancer!
aqua_newyear: We've finally found you! Now roll over like a good little lion and give back our mochi!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Whimper*
aqua_newyear: It's too late to act like a cute little kitten! 
aqua_newyear: Go on, Kazuma! Get it!
kazuma_newyear: What?! Why me?! If I get too close, it's just going to bite 
kazuma_newyear: me! I'm not going through that again!
megumin_newyear: I suppose there's no alternative, then. 
megumin_newyear: Allow me to— 
Lion Dancer Cub: *Cronch*
megumin_newyear: Yeeeooouch!!! My leg!!!
kazuma_newyear: What are you doing getting bitten?! 
kazuma_newyear: Aqua, the flute!
aqua_newyear: Got it! Have a taste of my beautiful music!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Whimper* Awooo!
Lion Dancer: Roooaaarrr!!!
kazuma_newyear: What was that?!
aqua_newyear: Oh no. The lion dancer cub must have called for its parents.
kazuma_newyear: Are you serious?! Wait, I feel like this could be a 
kazuma_newyear: good omen during our New Year's festivities.
Lion Dancer: Grrraaaaaahhh!!!
kazuma_newyear: No, I take that back! That thing looks really mad! 
kazuma_newyear: Let's get out of here!
Lion Dancer Cub: *Whine*
megumin_newyear: I sure hope it's not calling us bullies...
kazuma_newyear: Still, the more I look at that adult lion dancer, the more it looks like the ones in Japan.
kazuma_newyear: Is this like the time with the Winter Shogun? Is it the embodiment of some aspect of Japan? 
kazuma_newyear: How annoying! This is supposed to be a fantasy world!
Lion Dancer: Grrraaaaaahhh!!!
megumin_newyear: What the—?! Just how fast is that thing?!
darkness_newyear: Kazuma! 
darkness_newyear: Watch out!
Lion Dancer: Rrraaaggghhh!
darkness_newyear: Aaa
darkness_newyear: aaaaaaaaah!
kazuma_newyear: D-Darkness, are you all right?! 
kazuma_newyear: I'll save—
darkness_newyear: Wait! P-Please, if you'd just allow me to savor this for j-just a little longer—!
kazuma_newyear: Oh, that's right. 
kazuma_newyear: How do I always forget this about you?
darkness_newyear: H-How wonderful! 
darkness_newyear: I never thought my wish for the new year would come true so quickly!
darkness_newyear: Kazuma, you were absolutely right! Happy New Year! This holiday is the absolute greatest!
megumin_newyear: No fair! Darkness shouldn't be the only one who gets her wish! 
megumin_newyear: I'm going to fulfill mine as well!
megumin_newyear: Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark—
kazuma_newyear: How is this any different than normal?!
aqua_newyear: Who cares, as long as we can get our mochi back! Let's take 
aqua_newyear: care of this thing so we can go home and eat!
Lion Dancer: Awooo!
kazuma_newyear: Here it comes!
