Yunyun - P4
ナレーション: One day, in the guild tavern, Yunyun was playing a game of concentration in a corner all alone...
ynyn: I'm pretty sure the seven of hearts is right...here!
miia: Playing cards, eh? By yourself?
ynyn: M-Me? No! I mean, yes. But only because I wasn't busy, 
ynyn: and not because I had no one to play with. Yep.
miia: Ah. So you're bored? Why not play with me, then? In the 
miia: forest!
ynyn: Eh?! Y-You want me? To do something?! With you???
miia: So...you don't wanna go?
ynyn: No, no! I do! More than anything!
ynyn: Honestly, I've never climbed a tree in my life.
miia: Don't worry, I'll 
miia: teach you!
ynyn: I see this...requires...upper body strength...
miia: One branch at a time! Just like this, see?
miia: Agh!
ynyn: Oh no! Mia's falling...!
miia: Ta-dah!
ynyn: ...Uh oh. 
ynyn: Aaagh!
miia: When you're climbin' a tree, worry what's ahead, not who's 
miia: below. Or else you'll...ya know.
ynyn: Yeah, I guess I freaked out a little when I saw you fall... 
ynyn: Nice reflexes though, Mia.
miia: I'm know! I'm the fastest. Ran all up 'n' down Samuidoh more 
miia: times than I can count. Now let's follow the path to town!
ynyn: S-Sure thing!
ynyn: What a crowd! 
ynyn: And so many food stalls.
miia: Some of that looks mighty tasty. *Sniff sniff*
miia: Ew!
ynyn: What's wrong, Mia?
miia: That old lady over there...
miia: Smells super icky! 
ynyn: Huh?!
Food Stall Customer: How rude indeed. That, child, is the scent of luxury—first-rate perfume.
ynyn: It is a little on the strong side, especially for Mia's sensitive beastman nose.
Food Stall Customer: Also! How dare you call a spry woman of her thirties "old"! 
miia: Thirties? You're clearly in your fiftie—
ynyn: S-Sorry about my friend here. It was nice meeting you!
ynyn: Mia, some things you shouldn't say out loud, even if they're true.
miia: Amy's said that before too. 
miia: Said I need to use more, uh... "Tax"?
ynyn: "Tact," I think.
ynyn: It means to choose your words carefu—
miia: Ooh! Over there! Fruit! Super tasty looking too!
ynyn: Hey, I wasn't finished!
miia: Well, finders eaters! 
miia: Yes! Time to dig—
ynyn: Wait, Mia! 
ynyn: Light of Saber!
miia: Yowza! What's the big idea?
ynyn: That's not fruit. It's a tiny monster PRETENDING to be 
ynyn: fruit. See its mouth—lined with fangs?
miia: Well hogtie me and take me to market. You're right. I owe you 
miia: big time, Yunyun!
ynyn: Hehe, don't mention it.
miia: You're a good egg, Yunyun. Bit of a loner, but I like you. 
miia: Which is why I'm takin' ya under my wing—as my disciple!
ynyn: Disciple?! I'd much prefer to be 
ynyn: f-friends. How does that sound? 
miia: From this day forth, I'm your master! I'll teach you all I 
miia: know about having fun. Climbing trees...the works!
ynyn: Meaning we can do things...together...?
miia: Yep. Master and disciple gotta eat together, and practice sleepovers!
miia: I read it in a book recently!
ynyn: Eating together. Sleepovers. Those are all textbook friend activities! 
ynyn: Meaning...
miia: Ever since I read that book, I wanted a disciple all for me! 
miia: Well, whaddaya say?
ynyn: I-I'd be honored!
ynyn: ...Master!
miia: Then it's official, my disciple. Let the playing begin!
ynyn: Y-Yes, master!
ナレーション: Though on paper the two were master and disciple, Yunyun enjoyed having a friend in Mia.
