A Harvest Festival for This Northern Land! - P3
ナレーション: The next morning, Kazuma and company met Amy outside bright and early...
miia_samuido: Good morning! Sorry for the wait, everyone!
chris_winter: Good morning. 
chris_winter: Whoa! What's with the outfits?
Amy_samuido: Aren't they just adorable?
squall_samuido: Mia couldn't wait to show them to you, so we put them on a bit early.
darkness_winter: Are those the Harvest Festival outfits? You three look great.
kazuma_winter: Yeah, they give off a nice festival vibe. 
kazuma_winter:  But why did you have to wake us up early just to show us clothes?
Amy_samuido: This was just an added bonus. My real purpose was this.
aqua_winter: A giant leaf and...an instrument? I've never seen one like that before.
Amy_samuido: It's used for the Harvest Festival dance. 
Amy_samuido: This instrument can be used to control the movements of leaves.
miia_samuido: Let's get started! We're all having a dance practice today!
miia_samuido: Yeah, that's it! You're doing great! Now for the last part. 
miia_samuido: Stand up and squat down two times!
Everyone: A 
Everyone: one! 
Everyone: A one!
Everyone: A one!
Everyone: A two!
Amy_samuido: That was great, everyone. You've already improved so much.
kazuma_winter: Ugh... My legs are on fire...
chris_winter: M-Mine too...
megumin_winter: My arms may fall right off my body. These leaves are a lot heavier than they look.
darkness_winter: This is rather grueling. 
darkness_winter: I may need to add it to my training routine. I'm impressed, Mia. You're not even out of breath.
miia_samuido: Hehe! I practiced a lot!
aqua_winter: I'm more interested in that instrument than dancing. 
aqua_winter: Do you mind if I give it a try, Amy?
Amy_samuido: Sure, be my guest. 
Amy_samuido: It's quite difficult, though. Just learning how to play notes takes—
aqua_winter: Lalala... ♪
squall_samuido: What's this? She's playing like a master.
Amy_samuido: W-Wow! It's taken me three years of practice...
miia_samuido: Aqua! Teach me how to play!
kazuma_winter: She's always demonstrating talents in the strangest things. 
kazuma_winter: I really think she should consider a job change. 
chris_winter: Ah... It's so warm...
darkness_winter: It sure is. Soaking your feet after a long workout always feels wonderful.
squall_samuido: Here, eat this. Consider it a reward for a good practice.
miia_samuido: Roasted corn! 
miia_samuido: Hooray! *Munch munch*
Amy_samuido: Oh, dear. Mia, you're eating all of it. 
Amy_samuido: You must share with everyone. 
kazuma_winter: Aqua, make sure you don't accidentally purify the hot spring this time, will ya?
aqua_winter: Sure thing. 
aqua_winter: It's so cozy though. 
aqua_winter: I'm getting a little sleepy...
kazuma_winter: What the heck did I just say?! The water's sparkling! Wake up!
megumin_winter: *Sigh* The shining view stirs my soul. A blanket of quiet snow, and a twinkling sky. 
megumin_winter: Hey, look at that!
megumin_winter: If you connect those stars there, they make Chomusuke!
darkness_winter: What?! 
darkness_winter: Wh-Where? Show me, show me!
chris_winter: Hehe... It's nice taking a moment to relax like this. Thanks again for inviting me.
kazuma_winter: The festival's tomorrow, huh? Good luck in the Gluttonous Dedication, you two.
miia_samuido: Of course! 
miia_samuido: I'd rather chow down on some meat rather than vegetables, though.
chris_winter: You sure are quite the carnivore, Mia. 
chris_winter: If I were to be in an eating contest, though, I prefer Samuidoh's veggies.
miia_samuido: Really? 
miia_samuido: You should be in the Gluttonous Dedication, then!
chris_winter: What?! 
chris_winter: No, I wasn't really planning on—
Amy_samuido: Oh, that's a wonderful idea. We would love for you to take part.
chris_winter: Um, I...
kazuma_winter: Chris, you need to learn to speak up when you don't want to do something. 
chris_winter: I-I know that. 
chris_winter: Actually, I think I'll—
miia_samuido: You're going to join us?! 
miia_samuido: I'm so super duper happy! Yay, it's going to be the best with Chris there! The best!
Amy_samuido: I love to see you so happy, Mia. 
Amy_samuido: Thank you, Chris.
chris_winter: Oh, um... 
chris_winter: Sure, don't sweat it! I'll do my best!
