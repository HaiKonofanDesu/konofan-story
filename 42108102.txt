A Bon Dance for This Crimson Demon Festival! - P2
komekko_yukata: Who wants yakisoba? Mouth-watering and filled with crispy cabbage! 
komekko_yukata: ...Man, I'm hungry.
miia_yukata: Takoyaki right here! 
miia_yukata: We got the best eats in town. Get yours before we're sold out!
ynyn_yukata: Y-Yeah, what they said. It's s-so...good... 
ynyn_yukata: You know what, never mind.
miia_yukata: C'mon, Yunyun! Put your heart into it!
ynyn_yukata: I hate to say it, but I'm not in this to win.
ynyn_yukata: Standing up on stage? And rattling off lines like some one-man play? 
ynyn_yukata: That's more a punishment than a reward. 
ynyn_yukata: Still...
kazuma: Whew... Finally, a welcome lull in business. 
kazuma: Okay, you three take a break while you can.
miia_yukata: Really? Can we eat at the other stalls?
kazuma: While contributing to the competition's sales isn't ideal... eh, why not? Reasonably, though!
miia_yukata: Yee-haw!
komekko_yukata: Me too! I'm starving.
ynyn_yukata: I'll treat you. 
komekko_yukata: Really? 
komekko_yukata: Thanks, Yunyun! You're the coolest!
ynyn_yukata: It's nice to be here with f-friends. 
ynyn_yukata: I think I can make it to the end, this time. Last year it was a little scary. 
aqua: If you're feeling extra-generous, mind getting me a cup o' cold goodness?
kazuma: Don't exploit her on her break. 
kazuma: Yunyun, we've got a lot of work to do later, so rest while you can.
ynyn_yukata: Thanks a bun—
miia_yukata: Yunyun, let's hurry! The break'll end before we know it!
ynyn_yukata: Mia, 
ynyn_yukata: you don't need to pull me...!
kazuma: Looks like she won't have much of a break.
miia_yukata: Those things! On the skewers! I'll take ten!
Crimson Demon A: I see someone brought their appetite. Here, ya go, missie! Ten Beast of Legend skewers, just for you!
miia_yukata: *Nom nom* Twenty more, please!
ynyn_yukata: Did she even chew? And what's this Beast of Legend...?
Crimson Demon B: Beef. Don't overthink it. Twenty more for the little lass!
komekko_yukata: I'll have the Chocolate-Covered Banana...of Madness?
Crimson Demon A: My, you have a fine eye! But be forewarned, if that eye should peer into the abyss, it may peer back. 
ynyn_yukata: Yep. It's just a regular old chocolate-covered banana.
Komekko, Mia: That was delicious!
ynyn_yukata: You ate all that, already?!
miia_yukata: I want a heap o' grilled kraken, frankfurters, and buttered taters too!
komekko_yukata: Yunyun, you okay on money?
ynyn_yukata: Wh-Why wouldn't I be? I said I'd treat you, didn't I?
Crimson Demon B: Well if it isn't the chieftain's daughter. I take it the little beastman's your friend?
ynyn_yukata: F-Friend?! 
ynyn_yukata: ...Y-Yes! Yes! That's exactly what she is.
miia_yukata: One more of everything, please!
komekko_yukata: Same here!
Crimson Demon B: You got it! You two can really put it away.
ynyn_yukata: They're eating more? My funds are getting low... 
ynyn_yukata: I'll admit though, it is fun to visit the stalls like this.
arue: Yunyun, we've got an emergency!
ynyn_yukata: Whoa, Arue. Where's the fire?
arue: Listen to me, and try to stay calm. It's the chieftain—
arue: your father...!
ynyn_yukata: Dad!
kazuma: You came at a good time. 
kazuma: He just woke up.
Chieftain: Yunyun, you came...
komekko_yukata: Chieftain, what's wrong?
megumin: He fell from a ladder while stringing up lanterns. 
megumin: Luckily, he wasn't seriously injured. Just some bumps and bruises.
arue: Unfortunately, this may not be an accident.
ynyn_yukata: Huh? What do you mean?!
kazuma: The chieftain says he felt like the ladder was tipped.
miia_yukata: But who'd do such a horrible thing?
Chieftain: It is with great regret, O daughter of mine, that I... Urgh! I-I am to part ways with you...so...early...
ynyn_yukata: Dad, no! 
ynyn_yukata: Please, try to hold on!
Chieftain: But before I do...listen well. This is but only the...beginning...
ynyn_yukata: The beginning? Of what?! Dad...!
Chieftain: Be on your guard, my dear. For from the shadows, the Bon Dancer stalks us all...
megumin: Say...what?!
arue: The Bon Dancer? 
arue: I can't believe my ears.
komekko_yukata: We're doomed! We're all doomed!
kazuma: Uh, what's this Bon Dancer everyone's so terrified of? 
kazuma: Back home, it's just a typical summer custom!
