A New Year for This Starter Town! - P6
Lion Dancer: Grrrrrrrrr...
Lion Dancer Cub: *Whimper*
kazuma_newyear: All right! It's looks like they're starting to tire! 
kazuma_newyear: Darkness, you all right?!
darkness_newyear: I was kind of hoping to feel its fangs for a little longer... 
kazuma_newyear: Why do I bother asking... 
kazuma_newyear: All right, Megumin! Do it!
aqua_newyear: Don't you dare harm the mochi! 
aqua_newyear: No direct attacks, got it?
megumin_newyear: Understood! Now, time to repay you in full for biting my leg! 
megumin_newyear: EX-PLOSION!!!
Lion Dancer: Awoooooo!!!
darkness_newyear: Such power!
kazuma_newyear: Wow. I feel like that was even stronger than usual.
megumin_newyear: Yes... That felt...great...
Lion Dancer Cub: *Whimper*
Lion Dancer: Grrrrrrrrr...
aqua_newyear: Looks like the lion dancers escaped the worst of it... 
aqua_newyear: But they're completely exhausted. Let's finish them!
megumin_newyear: Huh? I just fired off my explosion magic, but somehow 
megumin_newyear: I still have enough strength to stand.
darkness_newyear: Oh, that reminds me! A lion dancer's bite is imbued with natural energy, and can heal and empower people!
kazuma_newyear: Oh, that explains why her blast was stronger. 
kazuma_newyear: Now that you mention it, I feel pretty good myself...
darkness_newyear: Indeed... I feel it as well!
aqua_newyear: Ah! They're going for the mochi!
megumin_newyear: Do you think they might just be hungry?
kazuma_newyear: They're probably exhausted from biting people and 
kazuma_newyear: giving them so much energy. Go ahead and eat up.
Lion Dancer Pack: Awooo!
aqua_newyear: Hey, that's my mochi! 
aqua_newyear: I'm tired too, you know!
darkness_newyear: I think we can let them have this batch. We'll just make some more when we get back.
megumin_newyear: I want to try the mallet this time!
kazuma_newyear: I'll make you all the mochi soup you like, Aqua. 
kazuma_newyear: So just let them have this batch, okay?
aqua_newyear: Could you make some mochi with sweet soybean flour, too?
kazuma_newyear: Sure. I'll make whatever you like.
aqua_newyear: In that case, you've got a deal! 
aqua_newyear: Let's go home and get to work!
kazuma_newyear: All right, Kazuma's New Year's special is ready!
megumin_newyear: Mochi soup!
darkness_newyear: Wow, it smells great!
aqua_newyear: Time to eat! *Munch munch*
kazuma_newyear: Slow down! You're starting to look like a lion dancer. 
kazuma_newyear: The year just started and things are already crazy... 
kazuma_newyear: I guess my peaceful year is just a dream.
aqua_newyear: This calls for a bottle of my best bubbly! We should 
aqua_newyear: celebrate the new year in style!
darkness_newyear: That sounds great!
megumin_newyear: Yum... That was absolutely delicious! Kazuma, is there 
megumin_newyear: enough for seconds?
aqua_newyear: Kazuma, I'll take another helping too!
darkness_newyear: And me as well!
kazuma_newyear: Comin' right up! No need to rush, there's plenty left. 
kazuma_newyear: I get the feeling this is going to be another busy year.
ナレーション: Though he wished to just relax in peace, Kazuma decided that there were far worse ways to spend his days...
