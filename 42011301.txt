ナレーション: In search of Arue, our heroes found themselves wading deep in verdant underbrush...
megumin: Arue? Holler if you hear us!
aqua: Why call us out to the boonies? This better be important.
darkness: Important enough for her to leave the Crimson Demon Village. 
darkness: That much we know for certain.
kazuma: She's probably lurking somewhere nearby so she can ambush us with a dramatic entrance. 
kazuma: Honestly, Arue—if you're here, come out already!
arue: Aaaaaaaaah!
aqua: Hey, that sounds like her!
megumin: Arue, what's going on?!
arue: Ungh... Shouldn't have let my guard down...
darkness: How'd you get like that?! ... No seriously, I have to know.
Deadly Bunny: *Squeak squeak*
kazuma: Monsters on our six!
arue: There's no escape for me. Not like this. Leave me behind— It's the only way!
arue: I'll be trampled, no doubt. But I beg you... Pay me no heed!
darkness: Trampled?! 
darkness: ...Let's trade places! Pretty please?
kazuma: This is no time for your nonsense!
aqua: Yeah, we have to save Arue!
arue: Only the legend herself can save me now... The greatest wizard the Crimson Demon Clan ever produced.
kazuma: Uh...
kazuma: "Greatest wizard?"
megumin: ...
megumin: Ohoho. 
megumin: Bwahahaha! 
megumin: You called, Arue?
megumin: It is I, Megumin! Crimson spellcaster of universal fame! Master of explosion magic! I am evil's bane!
aqua: Wow. Megumin's really perked up!
kazuma: All this "greatest wizard" talk must've stoked her Crimson Demon taste for melodrama.
megumin: Fear not, frail maiden! Your savior has arrived! Witness 
megumin: your tormentors turn to ash in a single fiery blow!
arue: A single blow? Why not draw the battle out, culminating 
arue: in an epic comeback after a near defeat?
kazuma: She's certainly particular about how she should be saved...
Deadly Bunny: *Hippity hop* 
aqua: Uh oh, Arue's about to get it!
kazuma: The rest of this inane theater can wait until after we clean house! C'mon, guys!
