Rin - P1
dust: Rin, something awful has happened!
lean: What did you do this time?
dust: Uh, I...kinda ran someone over with my wagon. If I don't pay up by today, they'll toss me in jail!
dust: But I'm broke at the moment, so... 
dust: Hey! You're willing to help a friend, right?
lean: Forget it.
dust: Your fellow party member is in dire straits! Don't you have any compassion at all?
lean: Sounds like you're in trouble.   
dust: That's all you've got to say? You could, ah, give me whatever's in your wallet!
lean: C'mon, I know you're lying about the wagon. I can't believe 
lean: you'd stoop so low just to get money out of me!
dust: Fine, I'll tell you the truth. You see... Keith got hurt 
dust: real bad during a quest, and—
lean: I just bumped into Keith.
dust: Ungh...
dust: Actually, I meant to say it was Taylor! He got these bad stomach cramps, and—
lean: He seemed fine when we ate lunch together today.
dust: Yeesh!
lean: Let me take a wild guess... Gambled away all of your money again?
dust: You know me too well... You're a good friend.
lean: Don't try to weasel your way out of this! 
lean: Listen, Dust... When you act like this, I can't trust you.
dust: Who cares! I don't need your trust! I need money! 
dust: Please, Rin!
lean: It's not gonna happen!
dust: Don't be like that! 
dust: I'm begging you, Rin! We can cut the next reward any way you want!
lean: *Sigh* 
lean: You really are impossible. Just this once, got it?
dust: Oh, Rin! You're an amazing woman!
lean: That sure cheered you up.
lean: I'm holding you to your promise about our next quest. And don't forget about the rest of what you owe me, either.
dust: Of course not! With a little luck, I'll be paying you back\n
dust: ten-fold later today! Gwahahahahaha!
lean: I know he's just going to gamble it all away again.
？？？: Hehehe...
lean: Oh, Luna... Did you see all that? How embarrassing...
luna: Dust never learns, does he? Furthermore... 
luna: He's always coming after me too.
lean: I guess I should probably learn my lesson, too. I always end up lending him money.
lean: I'm spineless. I really should give him a piece of my mind!
luna: Please forgive me for asking, but why are you in a party with Dust in the first place?
lean: Hmm... I suppose it's because he can't survive on his own. 
lean: He's like a little brother to me.
lean: I guess we're kind of stuck with each other. What's the point in cutting him loose now?
lean: And besides... I know what he seems like, but he has a good heart. He looks after his friends.
lean: He acts selfish, but you can always count on him in a fight.
luna: Such kindness.
lean: Kindness? 
lean: I'm not sure I'd go that far, but...
luna: No, I wasn't talking about Dust just now. I meant you, Rin.
lean: Huh? M-me? 
lean: I-I don't know about all that...
luna: Hehe... I think you're both kind and thoughtful.
lean: Ahaha... This is embarrassing. I just don't want my little brother to get in trouble...
dust: Rin! Please listen to me, Rin! I know I can win in the next race!
dust: Finally, the winds of fate are blowing my way! 
dust: If you lend me just a bit more, we'll make a fortune!
lean: Luna, forget everything I just said.
luna: Hm?
dust: We're ready to cash in! Just five thousand Eris and I can make every—
lean: Are you crazy? I just loaned you money!
dust: C'mon...there's no need to be so stingy! Look, I'm literally 
dust: begging you here! Please, Rin!
lean: Absolutely not!
lean: Say, Luna... What's the most difficult quest you've got? 
lean: It's high time he learned how to make his own money!
dust: No... That's not fair... 
dust: Rinnnnnn!
lean: I never said it was fair!
lean: I'm tired of bailing you out all the time.
luna: Ahaha...
