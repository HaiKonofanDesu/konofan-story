A Quest for This Devilish Little Sister! - P5
ナレーション: Komekko and Hoost were hunting down robber ducks, and were making rather good progress too.
Robber Duckling: *Quack quack*
komekko: Hey, goblin—c'mon my mouth's starting to water.
horst: Don't stand there slobbering. Corner the darn thing and I'll incinerate it with a well-placed Inferno.
komekko: No incineration. A light braise would be preferred.
horst: Who cares? All we need to do is kill 'em dead.
komekko: I care. Immensely. 
komekko: Also, I'm tired from walking. Hoist me up on your back. Now, please!
horst: How about no? I'm not your chef or your mule.
Murder Bear: Graaaaaahhh!
horst: Tch. This bear must've caught the scent of our soon-to-be prey.
komekko: Uh oh! 
komekko: Better ward the thing off before it swipes our dinner. 
komekko: Rahhh!
horst: Hey, get back here! You are the size of a bean. A BEAN. Stop!
Murder Bear: Graaaaaahhh!
horst: Oh, for hell's sake... HRAAAGH!
Murder Bear: Nrrrgh... Ga-hahhh...
komekko: Yay! Bonus bear meat! 
komekko: Nice going!
darkness: Komekko created a diversion, allowing Hoost to attack from the beast's flank. A wonderfully executed strategy.
kazuma: "Strategy" isn't a word I would apply to this situation. 
kazuma: Regardless, Hoost seems to check out. Megumin?
megumin: Don't think I'll crack so easily. They still have to complete the quest.
Robber Ducklings: *Quack quack*
komekko: Here comes the main course. *Drool* 
komekko: Hoost, get at 'em.
horst: *Sigh* So I blast them? On low heat?
komekko: Yes, don't forget. B-r-a-i-s-e-d.
ナレーション: The area instantly transformed into fields of charred earth, permeated by the fragrance of perfectly roasted ducks.
komekko: Hehe... Behold my power!
horst: You mean MY power!
komekko: Nope. My order, my power. 
horst: *Sigh* I no longer have the energy to argue with you. 
komekko: That was hardly a match. I'm simply far too strong.
？？？: *QUACK*
komekko: Huh. Hear that?
Robber Ducky: *QUACK*
komekko: It's huge!
horst: Looks like daddy's mad!
komekko: Mad... 
komekko: and delicious. *Drool*
horst: Get back here, you small bean!
Robber Ducky: *QUACK*
darkness: Watch 
darkness: out!
komekko: Huh?
kazuma: Good job, Darkness! Hold the brute down!
megumin: Komekko! Komekko! Are you hurt?!
aqua: That was a close call.
komekko: Sis?! Why are you here?
horst: They tailed you because they were worried of course.
megumin: This is a quest. You can't let your guard down, not even for one moment. Do you understand, now?
komekko: Sorry...
Robber Ducky: *QUACK*
darkness: This monster's so strong! The way it hits me... Yes, I like! 
darkness: Oh, I like it a lot!
kazuma: Though Darkness seems elated, 
kazuma: that doesn't detract from the mortal danger she's in. Let's bash this bird!
aqua: That works for me. I'm tired of eating toad all the time. 
aqua: Duck and bubbly is on the menu tonight!
megumin: Put away your disappointment to the side for now, Komekko. We have a monster to beat!
komekko: Roger that, sis. I won't drop my guard a second time!
komekko: Sic 'em, goblin!
horst: So I'm doing all the work—AGAIN?!
