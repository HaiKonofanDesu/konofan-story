A Harvest Festival for This Northern Land! - P4
ナレーション: The morning of the Harvest Festival arrived and Samuidoh 
ナレーション: was filled with people and exciting stalls...
aqua_winter: Mmm, everything smells so good. Roasted corn, buttered 
aqua_winter: potatoes, asparagus bacon... But where is the bubbly? 
megumin_winter: The whole town is swept up in the atmosphere. 
megumin_winter: I'm getting excited to see the main events!
kazuma_winter: You two are in high spirits, but...
chris_samuido: *Sigh* Morning...
darkness_winter: What's wrong, Chris? Your outfit is very fitting! But you don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
kazuma_winter: Apparently she's nervous about this Gluttonous Dedication she got dragged into and couldn't sleep well last night.
darkness_winter: A-Are you going to be all right? 
darkness_winter: Perhaps you should let them know you don't wish to participate. 
chris_samuido: Don't worry about me, Darkness. 
chris_samuido: Professional thieves are used to staying up all night. I'm just a bit sleepy.
Food Stall Man A: Come get your piping hot potatoes smothered in rich, creamy butter! They're simply delicious!
Food Stall Man B: Try our grilled eggplant with miso! Get it while it's hot!
aqua_winter: Everything smells so good! How do I pick? 
aqua_winter: Excuse me! One buttered potato, please!
Food Stall Man A: Thanks for your business!
aqua_winter: This looks delicious! 
aqua_winter: *Munch munch* 
aqua_winter: So good!
darkness_winter: Would you like some food, Chris? Perhaps it will help energize you. 
chris_samuido: Actually, I think I'll pass. 
chris_samuido: I've got the Gluttonous Dedication, after all.
megumin_winter: Let's try out a game! I've never heard of tomato scooping before. 
Food Stall Man C: Hello there! You young ladies have come to the right place! Have any of you ever tried tomato scooping?
chris_samuido: Can't say that I have.
Food Stall Man C: Is that so?! Well don't worry, it's quite simple. All you do is scoop tomatoes out of the water with this paper net.
Food Stall Man C: Tomatoes can only survive in water for a short time. How many can you save before your net breaks?!
kazuma_winter: Why is this a survival game? 
Food Stall Man C: Since this is your first time, I'll give you a net on the house. What do you say? 
chris_samuido: S-Sure, I guess I could give it a try.
chris_samuido: I'm sorry I'm late! 
squall_samuido: You're late. The Gluttonous Dedication is about to— 
squall_samuido: What the...?! Why do you have a cart full of tomatoes?!
megumin_winter: Chris won them all at the tomato scooping booth.
chris_samuido: I guess I was just lucky. It's like they jumped into my net. I only tried once, but ended up winning all these... 
chris_samuido: Hehehe.
aqua_winter: It was amazing! 
aqua_winter: They look good enough to eat now, but I guess we should wait until after the contest. 
？？？: Grrrrrrrrr...
kazuma_winter: Hmm? What was that sound? Megumin? 
megumin_winter: I didn't say anything. Kazuma's finally lost the plot. 
miia_samuido: Grrrrrrrrr... I'm hungryyyyyy!
kazuma_winter: M-Mia?!
Amy_samuido: Mia, please calm down! It'll just be a little longer. 
megumin_winter: What's wrong with her?! 
Amy_samuido: We skipped breakfast for the Gluttonous Dedication. She's steadily declining. 
miia_samuido: Grrrrrrrrr... Give me something to eeeeeeat!
darkness_winter: She's this bad after skipping a single meal?
miia_samuido: I smell ham! Who's hiding it?! 
miia_samuido: I need meat! 
miia_samuido: *Chomp*
kazuma_winter: Yeoooooouch! 
kazuma_winter: Mia, that's my leg!
megumin_winter: The hunger's taken complete hold of her. 
Amy_samuido: Snap out of it, Mia! You're going to upset your tummy if you eat dirty things! 
kazuma_winter: That's not the problem here! 
kazuma_winter: Ouch! 
kazuma_winter: Will somebody please 
kazuma_winter: get her off me already?!
chris_samuido: Oh! 
chris_samuido: Mia, look, tomatoes! Help yourself!
miia_samuido: Tomatoes are so good. *Nom nom nom* 
miia_samuido: Hm? What am I doing 
miia_samuido: eating all these tomatoes?
aqua_winter: She's finally regained her senses. We have Chris's tomato scooping skills to thank. 
megumin_winter: She ate nearly the entire cart.
chris_samuido: I never expected them to come in handy like this. 
chris_samuido: But Mia, you should probably stop there. The eating contest is—
miia_samuido: I'm still hungry! 
miia_samuido: *Chomp chomp*
kazuma_winter: She's eaten more than her own body weight in tomatoes. Where does she put it all? 
squall_samuido: We don't have time for that. 
squall_samuido: The Gluttonous Dedication is 
squall_samuido: about to start! Gather round, everyone!
ナレーション: At Squall's urging, a large crowd began to gather in front of a stage piled high with vegetables...
squall_samuido: Samuidoh's Harvest Festival is held once a year to pray for a bountiful crop. 
squall_samuido: It's time to find our Grand Vegetal!
squall_samuido: Without further ado, this year's Gluttonous Dedication is about to begin! 
squall_samuido: I ask you all to cheer on our contestants!
Villagers: YEEEAAAHHH!!!
kazuma_winter: Squall sure is getting into this.
darkness_winter: He did say it's been a while since he attended a festival. He's probably pretty excited. 
squall_samuido: Contestants, to the stage!
megumin_winter: Chris, Mia, Amy! Good luck!
chris_samuido: Right! Thanks!
aqua_winter: I'll be toasting you all with this bubbly!
kazuma_winter: Calm down on the drink, will you? You're unbearable enough without it. 
squall_samuido: Whoever is able to eat without stopping the longest will be crowned our Grand Vegetal!
squall_samuido: Now, let this year's Gluttonous Dedication...
squall_samuido: begin!
Mia, Amy: *Chomp chomp chomp*
chris_samuido: I don't know if I can keep up 
chris_samuido: with everyone's gusto. Maybe I'll start with something easy like this asparagus. 
chris_samuido: *Chomp*
chris_samuido: Huh? Wh-What the—?!
