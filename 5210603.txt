Glamorous Casino Bunny
dust_casino: I win this and all my losses are history! 
dust_casino: Gimme red seven, baby! Red seveeeeeen!
Dealer: !
Dealer: ...Black thirteen.
dust_casino: SON OF A SUCCUBUS!!!
dust_casino: Damn. I can salvage this though. I just need to play again. Can anyone here spare a few Eris? 
dust_casino: ...Huh?
wiz_casino: Dear patrons, we have an empty table right over here. Who fancies a play? Step right up!
dust_casino: Whoa, Wiz? That's some getup. 
dust_casino: Is this a hobby of yours?
wiz_casino: Dust?! N-No, of course not. 
wiz_casino: This is my...work outfit.
dust_casino: Work? I thought you sold magic items.
wiz_casino: Yes, well...I drove one of our branches into the red.
wiz_casino: If I go back to Axel without recouping at least some of my losses, Vanir is sure to let me have it. Hence, this job. 
wiz_casino: The wages are actually pretty good.
dust_casino: You don't say? 
dust_casino: Then I'll take a crack at it too!
wiz_casino: What? 
wiz_casino: Why, may I ask?
dust_casino: Because I'm flat broke. 
dust_casino: Plus, I happen to know a thing or two about casinos.
wiz_casino: Really? All you do is lose...
dust_casino: T-That's an incorrect assessment! I usually win at least one time outta ten!
wiz_casino: That's not a ratio you should declare with pride...
dust_casino: Hire me. You won't be sorry. Make me a dealer. After all, dealers can't lose.
wiz_casino: You don't have a single Eris to your name. You can't lose what you don't have.
dust_casino: I see... Then how about I hold on to your earnings? I'll take real good care of 'em.
wiz_casino: No, I think not, thank you very much!
wiz_casino: Sorry, but I have to return to work. Because if I don't, I won't be able to go back to Axel.
dust_casino: Hey, wait up! Wiz? 
dust_casino: Lend me some dough! Pleaaase!
