Spooky Trick-or-Treat
aqua_halloween2: Trick-or-treat!
Old Woman: Hehe. Here, have some treats.
aqua_halloween2: Thank you! The goddess Aqua shall watch over you!
miia_halloween: So many treats! I'm so happy!
aqua_halloween2: All our hard work making these costumes was worth it, huh?
miia_halloween: Halloween is awesome! 
miia_halloween: I want every day to be Halloween!
aqua_halloween2: That wouldn't be good. If every day were Halloween, you wouldn't have Valentine's Day or your birthday!
miia_halloween: You're right! That means no chocolates or presents! 
miia_halloween: You sure are smart, Aqua!
aqua_halloween2: Hehe! I'm glad someone finally recognizes that!
miia_halloween: Time to step up my game. 
miia_halloween: Hey, you!
Old Man: Oh! What a cute costume! Look, I've got lots of treats here.
miia_halloween: There's candy and marshmallows and even pies! 
miia_halloween: Aqua, I hit the jackpot!
Old Man: Hahaha! You sure are full of energy! Which would you like?
miia_halloween: All of it!
aqua_halloween2: Mia! Don't be greedy. Surely he can't give you everything.
Old Man: It's fine! Here you go.
aqua_halloween2: What?! Really? 
aqua_halloween2: Thank you, sir! The goddess Aqua shall watch over you too!
miia_halloween: One more time just for you, as a token of our gratitude...
Aqua, Mia: Trick-or-treat!
ナレーション: And so Mia and Aqua continued on. Rumor has it that they ended up with more than half the town's treats, but nobody knew for sure.
