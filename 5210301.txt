Axel Singing Contest
ナレーション: Wearing their outfits for the Axel Singing Contest, Megumin and Kazuma were hard at work rehearsing...
kazuma_kayoshow: I thought this outfit might be a bit too flashy at first, 
kazuma_kayoshow: but it's growing on me.
megumin_kayoshow: I still can't get used to mine. My shoulders are freezing.
kazuma_kayoshow: I think you look great. 
kazuma_kayoshow: Man, putting these on sure makes this whole thing feel real.
kazuma_kayoshow: We're actually going to be up on stage in these, singing.
megumin_kayoshow: Oh! Have you decided what you're going to say before we start?
kazuma_kayoshow: What do you mean?
megumin_kayoshow: Each group introduces themselves when they get up on stage.
kazuma_kayoshow: Oh... 
kazuma_kayoshow: You mean like how Lia's always like, 
kazuma_kayoshow: "Relax, you're with Lia now!" 
kazuma_kayoshow: Nope. I've got nothing.
megumin_kayoshow: Oh, you don't? 
megumin_kayoshow: In that case, allow me to help you come up with something perfect for the occasion!
megumin_kayoshow: Hehe... 
megumin_kayoshow: Let's see... 
megumin_kayoshow: An introduction for Kazuma... 
megumin_kayoshow: How about, "I am Kazuma! Ascendant from the chasms far below, 
megumin_kayoshow: drawn from the void, and clad in darkness, "
kazuma_kayoshow: Absolutely not! Why would I make up some ridiculously dark story for a bunch of strangers?!
megumin_kayoshow: Well, you should have some sort of introduction.
kazuma_kayoshow: I suppose they help get the audience excited, but I'd 
kazuma_kayoshow: rather not sound like a member of the Crimson Demons.
kazuma_kayoshow: I prefer, "I am Kazuma Satou! 
kazuma_kayoshow: The brave hero responsible for defeating the Devil King's generals!"
megumin_kayoshow: That's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it? You didn't actually deal any of the finishing blows.
kazuma_kayoshow: Th-The details aren't important!
megumin_kayoshow: I think you should go with the one I came up with!
kazuma_kayoshow: Pass.
megumin_kayoshow: Why not?!
ナレーション: The pair argued over their introductions right up until the show began...
