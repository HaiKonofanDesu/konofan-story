God's Blessing on Cecily's Birthday! (2023)
cecily: Axis holy water is a wondrous part of a balanced breakfast! It even helps you live a longer life! Make sure to get yours now!
aqua: "One drink instantly fixed my chronic skin problems. 
aqua: I don't get constipated anymore either!"
aqua: "I lost a ton of weight. Got taller, too! The perfect drink for those looking for a growth spurt!"
cecily: That's just a small portion of the feedback we've received! 
cecily: Stop by your local Axis church while supplies last!
kazuma: *Sigh* Cecily's out recruiting for the church again, I see. 
kazuma: She's even enlisted Aqua's aid. What an operation.
darkness: What a work ethic. 
darkness: Today's Cecily's birthday, as I recall.
megumin: Seeing how immersed she is in her Axis duties, she likely forgot. 
megumin: Guess it's up to us then, eh? 
megumin: ...Hey, over here!
cecily: One bottle of holy water, coming right up— 
cecily: Oh, Megumin!
cecily: Interested in some holy water? 
cecily: It's only available to members of the church. I take it you've finally come around?
megumin: Not even close. And I'll pass on the water. 
megumin: But, what do you have planned for tonight?
cecily: Tonight? Nothing in particular.
megumin: Then how about dropping by our place later for a birthday party?
cecily: Birthday party, you say? Whose?
megumin: Yours, silly. I guess you really did forget.
cecily: Oh me, oh my! 
cecily: My precious little Megumin—throwing a party for me? At her own abode? 
cecily: Can it truly be?!
kazuma: It can. I'll even bake you a cake.
darkness: And if there's anything else you want to eat, just say it.
aqua: I'll have some bubbly at the ready, too.
cecily: A birthday party with my beloved Megumin... *Pant pant* 
cecily: Can I survive the wait 
cecily: until this most sultry of nights?!
megumin: Allow me to re-emphasize—everyone else will be there too.
cecily: I shall bathe my body with holy water in anticipation!
megumin: I dare not imagine whatever it is you're thinking about...  
megumin: But so long as you're happy, I suppose. Hehe...
