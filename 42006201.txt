aqua: La-la-la-laaa! ♪
megumin: Aqua's humming. She must be in a good mood.
darkness: We did take on a highly lucrative quest. Much more so than our usual fare.
aqua: Lucrative AND safe. All we have to do is survey this land, with no monsters in sight. 
aqua: Plus there's that famous hot spring nearby.
aqua: Seriously, we hit the jackpot on this one! Must be our karma finally paying off!
aqua: So! Let's do the work, and then hit the hot springs.\n
aqua: It'll be like we're out on a picnic. Let's have some fun here!
kazuma: ...
aqua: Hey, Kazuma, what's with the pouty face? It's a fun quest! You remember what fun is, right?
aqua: Let me guess: you hate the word "picnic" because you never got invited to one, right?
kazuma: No, hey, the quest is fine. 
kazuma: And I got invited to things! I HAD friends! Jeez!
kazuma: But, uh, let me ask you something, just to make sure.\n
kazuma: Is this REALLY as safe as you're telling us?
aqua: What, you don't believe me?!
kazuma: Of course not. People with YOUR luck don't 'hit the jackpot.'
megumin: You're overthinking it. The quest details all check out. I looked.
darkness: She's right. There was a disaster there some time ago, and very few monsters ever since.
kazuma: ...So we really are just doing a straight-up geological survey.
aqua: Uh, yeah! That's what I've been trying to tell you!
kazuma: All right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Let's just—
Troll Warrior: Bwahahaha! We've been waiting for you, Kazuma Satou!
megumin: Troll warriors, a whole pack of them! What are they doing here?
Troll Warrior: We lured you here with that phony quest!
darkness: Ugh, and we fell for it, one and all!
Troll Warrior: For Lord Daniel, we're gonna... Hm?
kazuma: You dumbass! You walked us all right into this!
aqua: H-Hey! Quit pulling my cheeks!
kazuma: I knew it. I KNEW this was gonna happen. You ARE bad luck! Jeez, I even freakin' apologized...
aqua: I didn't mean to screw up!
Troll Warrior: Uh, hey, um... Hey, guys?
kazuma: Oh, get lost! We're busy! Just... come back later!
Troll Warrior: Okay, I guess— Hey, wait a minute! You little...
darkness: The trolls are enraged.
megumin: That's on you, Kazuma...
kazuma: M-Me?! No way, this is Aqua's fault!
aqua: It is not! We ALL fell for this!
darkness: Hmph! These trolls will pay for underestimating me. I will not lose to the likes of them!
Troll Warrior: Graaah!
kazuma: All right, fight now, argue later. 
kazuma: Here we go!
