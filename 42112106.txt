A Present on This Holy Night! P6
Reindeer Boss: Grrraaaaaagh...
ynyn_christmas: *Pant pant* 
ynyn_christmas: We managed to defeat them.
darkness_christmas: Reindeer are formidable foes... I never imagined I'd be kicked so many times. 
darkness_christmas: It was like a dream come true!
megumin_christmas: Hahaha! Now you know the power of my explosion magic!
megumin_christmas: Hey, Kazuma. This snow is really cold. Can you pick me up?
kazuma_winter: Yeah, yeah.
Reindeer Boss: *Grunt grunt*
kazuma_winter: Hm? Why's this reindeer rolling over on its back?
banil_christmas: It's a submissive pose. Reindeer show their bellies to those they deem stronger than themselves.
aqua_winter: That sounds more like a dog than a reindeer.
ynyn_christmas: Does that mean they will do what we say now?
banil_christmas: It does. Give them a command and test it out.
ynyn_christmas: O-Okay... 
ynyn_christmas: Sit!
Reindeer Boss: Rein!
megumin_christmas: Wow, it actually listened to you.
banil_christmas: Excellent, we have achieved our objective. If we leave now, we should reach town by morning.
kazuma_winter: Hey, wait! You demons may not get tired, but we're at our limit. 
kazuma_winter: We need to rest first.
banil_christmas: Fear not. Behold!
darkness_christmas: Is that...a sleigh? Where did you...?
banil_christmas: I cut down some nearby trees. With this, returning down the mountain should be a breeze.
megumin_christmas: Reindeer and a sleigh... 
megumin_christmas: It's like we're really Santa!
banil_christmas: Now we simply attach some reins and... There! Ready to go! 
banil_christmas: Hop on, everyone!
kazuma_winter: It really is like the real Santa! Awesome!
Reindeer Boss: Grrrrrrrrr...
aqua_winter: Whoa, there. 
aqua_winter: Reindeer sure are hardy beasts. 
aqua_winter: We made it all the way here without a break!
darkness_christmas: Indeed, which means we made it in time for Christmas Eve.
kazuma_winter: I don't get it. This is where Erika plays with children sometimes, right? 
kazuma_winter: So why are we here?
banil_christmas: Foolish question. You're the one who said Christmas is about the children.
banil_christmas: Children of Axel! Merry Christmas!
Girl A: Yay! It's Santa!
banil_christmas: Rejoice! For I, Old Saint Vanir, shall give you a special present today! Take whichever one you like!
Boy A: Wow! Old Saint Vanir is so generous!
Girl B: Thank you, masked Santa!
ynyn_christmas: Was this your plan from the start?
banil_christmas: Our toy sale was more profitable than expected. 
banil_christmas: Orphans deserve a visit from Santa too. 
banil_christmas: Anything else would be unfair, wouldn't it?
aqua_winter: This isn't right! You're a demon! 
aqua_winter: You're not supposed to do things like this!
kazuma_winter: Don't complain about someone doing a good thing. You could learn a thing or two from him, 
kazuma_winter: Goddess.
aqua_winter: Hmph! There's definitely something suspicious about this!
komekko: Welcome back, Sis!
megumin_christmas: Hey, Komekko! We just got back. Here, a present from me. 
megumin_christmas: I hope you like it.
komekko: Meat! So you're Santa, then! 
komekko: Merry Explosion!
megumin_christmas: That's great, Komekko! 
megumin_christmas: Merry Explosion!
banil_christmas: Now, who wants to ride on a sleigh pulled by reindeer?! 
banil_christmas: First come, first served!
Boy B: Meee! Meee! Yay!
komekko: Away, fierce beast with terrible antlers!
Reindeer Boss: Grrrrrrrrr...
kazuma_winter: All right! Time for a Christmas parade, everyone!
Everyone: Merry Christmas!
ナレーション: Vanir's lavish generosity at the town orphanage almost certainly sparked the subsequent rise in the popularity of Wiz's shop.
