kazuma: Dungeon exploration? 
kazuma: No way, that sounds like a royal pain.
banil: Don't say that. We're friends, are we not?
kazuma: You do help me out a lot... 
kazuma: I'd be fine if it were just easy dungeons, but I assume some of them are high level?
banil: But of course.
kazuma: Thanks, but no thanks. I'm not exactly hurting for money. 
kazuma: I'm not going out of my way to find danger right now. 
kazuma: Besides, that useless goddess never stops complaining when I accept your requests.
banil: Hmm... 
banil: How about this, then? You are free to keep any ore or other items of value you find along the way.
banil: I shall even accompany you on occasion, and the remuneration will reflect each dungeon's difficulty. 
banil: Not a bad deal, eh?
kazuma: Hmm... I can't argue with that, 
kazuma: but why go so far?
banil: Simple. 
banil: Everything is to satisfy my desire for destruction!
banil: I shall create an impossible dungeon, full of monsters and traps! And I'll be waiting at the end for any heroes who survive! 
banil: After our fierce battle is over, a sealed treasure chest will appear before them... 
banil: However, when they open it...
banil: All they'll find is a slip of paper which reads... "Empty!" 
banil: Oh, the look on their faces! That is how I wish to die.
kazuma: I've heard this all before, but I still don't get it.
banil: I don't need you to understand my sublime goals. 
banil: I just require your aid gathering more references to prepare my perfect dungeon.
banil: Our pitiful shopkeeper remains in ignorance, but I've finally accrued the capital necessary 
banil: to hire adventurers to explore for me! 
banil: Now go! Go find me the greatest dungeons in the world!
kazuma: I'm not sure what he considers a great dungeon, but this 
kazuma: might not be so bad. We can go exploring when we're bored.
ナレーション: And so Kazuma and company accepted Vanir's request to go explore various dungeons...
