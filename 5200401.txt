Pajama Party!
ナレーション: The heroines were wearing their cutest, comfiest pajamas and it was already late. But the party was just getting started...
megumin_pajama: I didn't hesitate one second! I unleashed my explosion magic! 
megumin_pajama: But despite everything, Kazuma...
wiz_pajama: It's all right, Megumin. You meant well. Besides, Vanir's just a big grump. He gets mad at me for stuff like that all the time.
wiz_pajama: He can be really mean! I try so hard to find stuff that will sell, but he calls it junk and... 
wiz_pajama: Hm?
ynyn_pajama: ...
megumin_pajama: You're awfully quiet tonight, Yunyun. We hardly ever get together for sleepovers. You should join in!
ynyn_pajama: Oh, sorry, Megumin. I've just never done anything like this before.
ynyn_pajama: It almost makes me feel like I have real friends!
megumin_pajama: Almost real friends? What are you talking about?
ynyn_pajama: Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought—
wiz_pajama: Of course we're real friends!
ynyn_pajama: Huh?
megumin_pajama: Wiz is right. I know I've been stubborn, but that's in the past. I consider you my friend now, Yunyun.
ynyn_pajama: No way! Really?! I must be dreaming! Say it again!
megumin_pajama: I'll say it as many times as you'd like. We're friends, Yunyun.
wiz_pajama: But just to be extra sure... We should go on a trip together!
megumin_pajama: That's a great idea! A little bonding time would really cement our friendship.
ynyn_pajama: A trip with friends?! I would love that! Do you promise?! 
ynyn_pajama: This is like a dream come true!
megumin_pajama: Yunyun...
megumin_pajama: Yunyun? Yunyun! Wake up!
ynyn_pajama: Wake...up?
megumin_pajama: Yeah! It's morning!
ynyn_pajama: ...
ynyn_pajama: Huh?
wiz: Good morning, Yunyun. Did you sleep well?
ynyn_pajama: What? Weren't we just talking in Megumin's room?
megumin: Uh, no. You fell asleep right after dinner. You're lucky we didn't freeze your bra.
ynyn_pajama: We didn't decide to go on a trip together?!
wiz: Trip? What trip?
ynyn_pajama: You mean it was all a dream? No! It can't be!
ynyn_pajama: Megumin! Can we please have another pajama party tonight?!
megumin: No way! It's not special if you do it all the time.
ynyn_pajama: Aw... After all that, I can't believe I fell asleep and missed everything! 
ynyn_pajama: Waaahhhhhh!
wiz: Yunyun, wait! What's wrong? Why is she crying?
megumin: Well, I called that one.
