God's Blessing on Vanir's Birthday! (2023)
banil: Mwahahaha! 
banil: Congratulations—to ME!
Kaz., Megumin, Darkness: Congratulations, Vanir...?
banil: I never dreamed a gathering such as this would be in the cards for me. 
banil: Thank you for your cooperation.
darkness: Since you said today is a special celebration, we brought cake.
banil: Cake? Splendid. 
banil: My heart overflows with giddy bliss! 
banil: Bwahahaha!
megumin: And what, exactly, are we here to celebrate today? 
megumin: I heard it's something personal.
kazuma: Personal? Like, your birthday?
darkness: And here I was thinking there would be some kind of demonic ritual.
banil: Hoho... You're both wrong. 
banil: Shall I enlighten you?
kazuma: Sure, it's always nice to know what we're celebrating.
banil: A point well made... 
banil: But alas! A secret this shall remain!
darkness: Wh-Why, pray tell?
megumin: Yeah, why have us come out to celebrate something we know nothing about, and apparently never will?
banil: Ahh, your frustration flows like an ambrosial nectar. 
banil: No delicacy is more fitting on a special day such as this!
banil: But the festivities have only just begun. 
banil: Lay bare your delicious vexation and celebrate—me, that is!
kazuma: Just tell us why we're celebrating already! 
kazuma: Ugh, I'm about to go ballistic!
ナレーション: Somehow, despite their frustration, Kazuma and friends were eventually able to enjoy themselves.
