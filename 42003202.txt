Snowy Mountain Panic - P2
erica_winter: If we defeat the leader, the other trolls should run away.
aqua_winter: There's too many of them. We'll never reach the leader!
darkness_winter: Fear not. I shall use myself as bait if I have to.\n
darkness_winter: No matter how hard they bite me with those sharp fangs...!!
kazuma_winter: Forget about Darkness. 
kazuma_winter: I have my own plan.\n
kazuma_winter: Megumin! Are the skiers all rounded up?!
megumin_winter: Yeah! They've gathered up at the bottom of the slope.
kazuma_winter: Great. Do your thing, Megumin. Blast those trolls to smithereens!
megumin_winter: At last, the moment I've been waiting for!\n
megumin_winter: Here it comes! Explosion!!
Troll Warrior: Roooooarrghh...
kazuma: Whoa!
ナレーション: Megumin's spell melted all of the snow, filling the whole area with steam...
kazuma_winter: Whew. It's finally ov— 
kazuma_winter: Huh? Where are we? Did someone teleport us?
aqua_winter: You know none of us can use teleport.
kazuma_winter: But all the snow is gone. What in the world—
kazuma_winter: —eraaaah! It melted! It all melted! Her spell vaporized all the snow on the mountain!
kazuma_winter: Not again... Couldn't I have a win, just once?
megumin_winter: Wahahaha! 
megumin_winter: An impressive display, if I do say so myself. My explosion magic simply can't be beat!
erica_winter: Hey! What did you guys do?!
erica_winter: I NEEDED that snow! I was going to fall down and have everyone fawn all over me!
darkness_winter: Yes, and I was going to spend hours being pelted by icy snowballs again and again...
kazuma_winter: Who cares about your weird obssessions? Oh man... What am I gonna do?!
Manager: What happened here?!
Manager: Oy, Kazuma! Where'd all the snow go? Explain this!
kazuma_winter: I-it's not our fault! You see, there were these trolls, and—
megumin_winter: Heh... Kazuma came up with a plan to beat the trolls, and my explosion magic melted the snow!
kazuma_winter: Megumin, he didn't need to know that!
Manager: Explosion magic, eh? Well, it certainly was spectacular. But good merchants always settle their debts... right?
kazuma_winter: Ch-chief? I'm not sure I like the look on your face right now...
Manager: So, how're you gonna make this right? You can either fill up the crater or pay for the damage.
kazuma_winter: Aaaargh! Why does it always end up like this?!
ナレーション: And so, Kazuma once again added to his debt. It seemed he would stay snowed under for quite a while...
