Thunder Kraken - P2
ナレーション: Kazuma and company had engaged a deadly kraken, in hopes of sating Mia's craving for grilled squid...
Thunder Kraken: Rrrrrrrrrghhh!
darkness_swimwear: Oh 
darkness_swimwear: my! 
darkness_swimwear: We may very well be crushed to death, Kazuma! Th-This is wonderful!
kazuma_swimwear: N-Not in the least! 
kazuma_swimwear: Nrrrgh!
Amy_swimwear: Are you two okay?! 
Amy_swimwear: We must help them, quickly.
megumin_swimwear: This monstrosity is stronger than I thought. 
megumin_swimwear: An Explosion would make short work of it, but the cave would, well... cave in. 
aqua_swimwear: Darkness is tough, but Kazuma's feeble body won't hold out much longer.
Thunder Kraken: Rrrrrrrrrghm!
darkness_swimwear: Wh-What now? More tentacles with which to further your depravity? 
darkness_swimwear: R-Release me from your perverse grip at once!
Amy_swimwear: Wh-What's the kraken doing? Is it trying to 
Amy_swimwear: eat them?
aqua_swimwear: I don't think so. It seems like it's...inspecting them? Why?! 
Thunder Kraken: Rrrgh!
megumin_swimwear: It chucked them away!
aqua_swimwear: Maybe they didn't seem very tasty?
darkness_swimwear: Like yesterday's trash, I was assessed and discarded. 
darkness_swimwear: Along with my dignity! 
darkness_swimwear: Coming here was the best decision ever!
kazuma_swimwear: I think...I may never understand you. 
Amy_swimwear: I'm just glad you two are safe and sound.
Thunder Kraken: Rrrgh... RRRRRRRRRGHMMM!!!
Amy_swimwear: Huh...? 
Amy_swimwear: Aaaaaahhh!
Thunder Kraken: RRRMMMMMMGH!!!
aqua_swimwear: It's after Amy now! What the heck's going on?
Amy_swimwear: S-Stay away from me!
darkness_swimwear: Look how the kraken's using its tentacles. It's sizing her up.
kazuma_swimwear: Meaning even krakens have food preferences!
megumin_swimwear: Not unlike a certain gawker, whose eyes were glued to Amy.
kazuma_swimwear: A-
kazuma_swimwear: Ahem. 
kazuma_swimwear: I believe there are more pressing matters at hand! 
kazuma_swimwear: Amy, run for the cave entrance!  We'll handle the kraken!
Amy_swimwear: Run for the entrance? 
Amy_swimwear: Okay, I'll try my best—for Mia!
Thunder Kraken: Rrrgh... Rrrgh... Rrrrrrrrrmmmghhh!
aqua_swimwear: The kraken's giving pursuit!
kazuma_swimwear: Megumin, once it's out of the cave I need you to—
megumin_swimwear: A Crimson Demon is always ready! 
Amy_swimwear: Kazuma, is this spot okay?
kazuma_swimwear: Perfect. Okay Megumin, you're up!
megumin_swimwear: The best is always saved for last! 
megumin_swimwear: EXPLOOOSION!
Thunder Kraken: Mmmrrraaaaaagh!
miia_swimwear: Now them's good eats! *Homph homph homph*
aqua_swimwear: Grilled kraken. Rice-stuffed kraken. Kraken sashimi. 
aqua_swimwear: And the perfect complement of a pint of bubbly!
miia_swimwear: Somebody pinch me. It's a literal mountain of squid! 
miia_swimwear: Thanks, Amy!
Amy_swimwear: Hehe... So long as you're happy, I am too. 
Amy_swimwear: Little Mia, you have sauce on your mouth. 
Amy_swimwear: You're too cute! 
Amy_swimwear: Everyone, from the bottom of my heart—thank you! You made Mia's little feast possible. 
kazuma_swimwear: I'll admit that kraken was tough. 
kazuma_swimwear: But Mia's smile makes it all worth it.
megumin_swimwear: Enough lies! We all know you came here to stare at scantily-clad fema— Hwrmff!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
megumin_swimwear: 　　　　　　　　　　　
kazuma_swimwear: Try the squid, Megumin! It's fresh off the grill!
megumin_swimwear: Mmmrrrf! Hwrrrngh!
darkness_swimwear: Kazuma! You'll kill her with squid, stop! 
darkness_swimwear: After all, she's our MVP for the day.
kazuma_swimwear: Hmph. That honor goes to Amy. It was only because she lured the kraken out of the cave Megumin could even do anything.
miia_swimwear: Gosh, you went through all that trouble for me? 
miia_swimwear: Thanks Amy! Guys!
Amy_swimwear: It only takes that single word from Mia to turn any and all 
Amy_swimwear: troubles into distant memories.
kazuma_swimwear: Hey, you're free to fawn over her, but don't spoil her TOO much, okay?
Amy_swimwear: Oh yes, I know. I actually exercise more moderation than you might think—
miia_swimwear: Hey, I could use another helping of squid sashimi.
Amy_swimwear: Coming right up, Mia, my dearie. Whatever you need. 
kazuma_swimwear: "Moderation," she says.
aqua_swimwear: But, like Amy said, seeing Mia this happy makes it all 
aqua_swimwear: worth it.
kazuma_swimwear: Can't argue with you there. And I don't see the point of 
kazuma_swimwear: all this squid without a keg to go with it! 
aqua_swimwear: Ooh, you're buying? Hats off to Kazuma!
ナレーション: With no shortage of squid, drink, and merry company, the beachside banquet went on until dawn...
