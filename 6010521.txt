God's Blessing on Wiz's Shop! (2022)
ナレーション: Wiz and Vanir were hard at work preparing a huge anniversary sale...
wiz: What about this fully automated shishkabob maker, Vanir? 
wiz: It'll be a hit!
banil: Stow that confounded contraption at once!  
banil: Our customers can already purchase all kinds of skewered food in town, no?
wiz: M-Maybe, but not on the road! This will let you skewer some monster meat whenever and wherever! 
wiz: Allow me to...
banil: Demonstrate? Fool, do no such thing! Catastrophe is sure to—
wiz: Just flip this switch...
banil: Gaaagh! 'Tis an inferno, vomited from the depths of hell itself! 
banil: We have a sale to launch! Not incinerate our store!
wiz: Yeeek! 
wiz: Cursed Crystal Prison!
wiz: *Pant pant*

wiz: I guess not being able to adjust the flame intensity is a bit of a design flaw...
banil: *Sigh* My dear, sweet, bungling Wiz. Your "talent" ever astounds me. How this shop remains standing, I'll never know.
wiz: Oh, such kind words, Vanir. But I've only made it this far thanks to you.
banil: That was NOT a compliment, you twit! ...But perhaps it is that naive pluck which keeps this establishment afloat.
wiz: Vanir?
banil: Never mind. It's the shop's anniversary. No time to sulk. 
banil: We must move stock and recoup our losses.
banil: Rejoice, my pitiful shopkeeper! For today is a day of celebration, and celebrate I shall! 
banil: Mwahahaha!
wiz: Oh...uhm, what should I do with the other shishkabob makers I ordered? There's about a hundred, give or take...
banil: Rejoice, my pitiful shopkeeper! For on this very special day, you've earned yourself a 
banil: VANIR'S DEATH RAY!!!
wiz: YEEE
wiz: EEEK!!!
ナレーション: It would be some time before the anniversary sale could commence...
