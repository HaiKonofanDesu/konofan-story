A Little Luck for This New Year! - P5 
ynyn_newyear: Show me what you're made of, Darkness! 
darkness_newyear: Gladly. Here goes... 
darkness_newyear: There! 
ynyn_newyear: Oh no! I'm down five already! 
kazuma_newyear: Ah, this reminds me of milk caps... 
kazuma_newyear: I played it a lot as a kid. 
megumin_newyear: The objective is simple: try to flip over your opponent's pieces. 
megumin_newyear: In practice, though, the strategy can be quite deep. 
ynyn_newyear: Now it's my turn... 
ynyn_newyear: Eh! 
ynyn_newyear: Aww, I'm such a klutz! 
kazuma_newyear: She's actually messing up on purpose to to prolong the game. 
kazuma_newyear: That's how lonely she is... 
banil_newyear: Hehehe... Quake in fear, pitiful shopkeeper, as my skills reduce you to a blubbering blob! 
banil_newyear: Hyah! 
wiz_newyear: We'll see who's pitiful after I crush you! 
wiz_newyear: Hwa! 
kazuma_newyear: A spinning top battle, eh? From the looks of it, Vanir's is the most upright. 
wiz_newyear: Don't count me out yet! My top is a new model. 
wiz_newyear: It may not have the best spinning ability, but wait until the end! 
banil_newyear: Your spinning top isn't good at spinning? 
wiz_newyear: It doesn't need to be. See, at the end, it explodes! You can't lose if there's nothing left! 
banil_newyear: Vanir's Destruction Ray! 
wiz_newyear: Nooo! My precious top! 
wiz_newyear: Explain yourself , Vanir! 
banil_newyear: That's my line! Are you trying to play a game or assassinate somebody? 
banil_newyear: This is why I call you pitiful! 
megumin_newyear: Destroyer alert! Destroyer alert! 
kazuma_newyear: ...What? 
megumin_newyear: Up! Look up! 
kazuma_newyear: Up? 
kazuma_newyear: WHOAAAAAA! It's the Destroyer kite! 
kazuma_newyear: Wait, isn't it a bit too big?! 
iris_newyear: Inspiring, isn't it? Aqua made it for me. 
megumin_newyear: Me too! Me too! Pleaaase let me fly it too! 
iris_newyear: I'll fly it around for a few more minutes, then I'll hand it to you. 
kazuma_newyear: That Aqua. Of course now she does something this impressive. 
aqua_newyear: Ahhh! That hits the spot! 
aqua_newyear: Nothing like drinking some cold bubbly in broad daylight! 
kazuma_newyear: I see the absence of company isn't preventing you from having a drinking party. 
aqua_newyear: All in duh name of stra-tuh-gee, right? 
aqua_newyear: If I gotta drink, I gotta drink! 
aqua_newyear: Come on out, cat monsterrrrrr! 
kazuma_newyear: Is she gonna be okay? She's pretty far gone... 
Money Cat: Meowneeey. 
kazuma_newyear: ...Oh. 
aqua_newyear: Heeey, da kitty's back! 
kazuma_newyear: Shush. You'll scare it off! 
wiz_newyear: On the contrary, Kazuma, maybe we should enjoy ourselves even more conspicuously? 
kazuma_newyear: You're right, maybe that's exactly what we need. 
kazuma_newyear: Everyone, look! Iris's kite! It's practically touching the sun! 
darkness_newyear: Of course. 
darkness_newyear: I am certain the princess is a natural at kite-flying. 
iris_newyear: Hehe. 
iris_newyear: Whoops! Almost slipped. 
iris_newyear: Thank you for compliment. 
megumin_newyear: Iris, Iris, lemme try already! 
iris_newyear: O-Oh, please don't push! 
iris_newyear: I'll lose control of theâ€” 
ynyn_newyear: I-Incredible. I've never seen a kite move like that! 
kazuma_newyear: For once, you're not alone. 
Money Cat: Meowneeey! 
banil_newyear: Excellent! The cat is entranced by the kite! 
kazuma_newyear: Now! Bind! 
Money Cat: Meowney?! 
kazuma_newyear: That'll hold it in place! It's now or never! 
aqua_newyear: Sounds like it's my tuhurn... 
aqua_newyear: Hmm? Which of the three kitties do I catch? 
kazuma_newyear: You're smashed! Ever heard of moderation?! Better yet, ever try it out?! 
Money Cat: Meowney...! 
wiz_newyear: The cat's trying to break free! 
kazuma_newyear: Everyone, surround it! 
Money Cat: Rawrrr!
