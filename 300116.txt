God's Blessing on This Wonderful Shop! - P2
ナレーション: After requesting a dream from the succubus shop, Kazuma turned down a succulent feast and went to bed early...
kazuma_jersey: Man, I'm even more excited than I thought I'd be. What should I do? Now I'm too wound up to sleep!
kazuma_jersey: Ahh, there's no way I'm snoozing like this. Maybe I'll take a bath and try to relax.
kazuma_towel: *Sigh*
kazuma_towel: Yeah, a bath should work all this nervous energy out. And I could stand to be a bit cleaner, anyway. 
kazuma_towel: Ahh...
kazuma_towel: *Snore* 
kazuma_towel: Hm?
kazuma_towel: Huh? The lantern went out. Oh, geez...did I doze off in here?
darkness_towel: Lalalalalala...
kazuma_towel: Wait, is that...Darkness? Is she in the dressing room? I should let her know... 
kazuma_towel: On second thought... I must have drifted off in the bath. That means...this is a dream!
darkness_towel: Wow, the moon sure is pretty tonight. 
darkness_towel: Huh? What the...?!
kazuma_towel: Hey.
darkness_towel: Wh-Wh-What are you...?!
kazuma_towel: You know, I always thought you were really hot. But seeing you now, just...wow. Those succubi know their stuff. 
kazuma_towel: Now then, how about we help each other out, Darkness? Cleaning up, that is. 
darkness_towel: Eh? Ah... 
darkness_towel: Hng?!
kazuma_towel: I see you approve. 
kazuma_towel: It is a surprise to see you here. I suppose I did ask for a dream about a beautiful woman... 
darkness_towel: Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?! Do you think this is some kind of dream?!
kazuma_towel: Hey now, I didn't ask for someone who was gonna play hard to get.
kazuma_towel: Though this does seem really accurate to your character. Impressive work, I guess. 
kazuma_towel: In any case, we shouldn't waste this time we have. How about you wash my back? 
darkness_towel: U-Um... Should I really be washing your back in a situation like this?
kazuma_towel: Of course! Why else would you be here?
darkness_towel: L-Listen... Do you realize what you're asking me to do?! What's gotten into you today?!
kazuma_towel: Okay, look. If this is my dream, we need to make some kind of progress here.
darkness_towel: Hey, are you saying there's something wrong with me? 
kazuma_towel: Lady, there's always something wrong with you.
kazuma_towel: Well, I suppose if this is a dream, it doesn't matter what we do. 
kazuma_towel: Come on, I'm getting cold! 
darkness_towel: Tch... Ugh... You say dream, but this is more like a nightmare...
kazuma_towel: Heh... You're pretty good at this.
darkness_towel: Ungh... Wh-Why is this happening? I know I should refuse, but... 
kazuma_towel: You know, you don't need to use that cloth.
darkness_towel: Huh?! Y-Yes I do! There's no way I'm washing you without a washcloth!
kazuma_towel: Oh, come on! It's worth a try, isn't it?
darkness_towel: Kazuma, w-what's the matter with you today?
？？？: Intruder! We have an intruder in the house!
darkness_towel: Is that...Aqua?
kazuma_towel: Great, has she come to ruin my dream, too? I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind!
kazuma_towel: Oy, Aqua!
aqua: Kazuma, come look! I caught an intruder caught in my barrier!
megumin: Aaaaaaugh! Aqua! Th-There's an intruder over here, too!
kazuma_towel: Who are you calling an intruder?!
Newbie Succubus: Ah... Ahh...
kazuma_towel: Huh? That's a succubus...
aqua: Ha, I caught this succubus in my barrier. I'm sure she was coming for you, Kazuma!
kazuma_towel: Wait... If that's the succubus, then the Darkness in the bath... 
megumin: Hehehe... Begone from this plane, foul being!
Newbie Succubus: Eeek!
aqua: Make your peace! This spell will eradicate your evil for good!
kazuma_towel: Run.
Newbie Succubus: What?
megumin: What?! Are you crazy, Kazuma? No matter how cute she is, she's still a succubus!
aqua: What's your game, Kazuma? You know a goddess such as I can't just let a demon go free.
kazuma_towel: I'll buy you some time. Use it... 
kazuma_towel: Run.
Newbie Succubus: But sir, it's my fault for being too inexperienced to sneak in undetected.
Newbie Succubus: I cannot allow you to be embarrassed. Let them vanquish me and pretend this never—
kazuma_towel: I won't allow it! 
darkness: Aqua! Megumin! Kazuma's been possessed by the succubus! She must be controlling him.
darkness: Foul demon! Degrading me like that... 
darkness: You shall fall by my hand!
kazuma_towel: No! I can't let you harm her!
aqua: Guess we've got to go through Kazuma first. I can handle the succubus after we handle him.
kazuma_towel: Some dreams are worth protecting... 
kazuma_towel: I'll get her to safety, no matter what!
Newbie Succubus: Sir...!
kazuma_towel: Bring it on! Hyaaaaaah!
kazuma_towel: Yaaaaaaugh! 
kazuma_towel: Ah!
ナレーション: As Kazuma made his grand sacrifice, the succubus leapt through the window to safety...
aqua: She got away... I'm going to set up a salt circle!
darkness: Ugh...
kazuma: Hey, listen. If all that seemed too weird for you, you didn't have to go along with it. 
darkness: You were possessed by the succubus, so you don't remember anything about last night?
kazuma: Er, yeah. I feel like I had a nice dream, but I can't actually remember it.
darkness: So that's what happened. Well... I suppose it couldn't be helped. Let's just forget it ever happened.
kazuma: Heh. If they think I was possessed by the succubus last night, there's really no reason to correct them.
ナレーション: Kazuma chose to enjoy the convenient excuse that fate had given him...
