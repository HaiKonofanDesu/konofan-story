Youthful School Life
kazuma_school: Yunyun, Erika. Could you try on these outfits for me, please?
erica: You said you wanted to ask me an important favor. Is this what you meant?
ynyn: I'm a little embarrassed to try this on...
kazuma_school: Please! Erika, you're going to look super cute! And Yunyun! I promise to take you to dinner if you do this!
Yunyun, Erika: All right, hand it over!
erica_school: Well, what do you think? I've never seen such strange clothes before, 
erica_school: but you were right! These look great on me!
ynyn_school2: I think you look really cute, Erika!
erica_school: Cute... 
erica_school: Yunyun, say it again!
kazuma_school: Ah! My dream has finally become a reality!
erica_school: Huh?! What do you mean by that?
kazuma_school: I dreamed 
kazuma_school: that you were both wearing outfits just like those and fawning all over me...
kazuma_school: It was the best dream ever! 
kazuma_school: Just seeing you dressed like this...
kazuma_school: I want to be pampered!
ynyn_school2: W-Wait, Kazuma! 
ynyn_school2: Oh, he's gone...
erica_school: We should probably leave him be.
erica_school: Instead, I was thinking I should go show off how absolutely adorable these outfits are to Lia and Cielo. Wanna come?
ynyn_school2: What?! Y-You really want me to come with you?!
erica_school: Of course! C'mon, let's go!
ynyn_school2: S-Sure!
ynyn_school2: This is like a dream come true! Kazuma, thank you so much!
ナレーション: For Yunyun, this would be a day she would remember for the rest of her life...
