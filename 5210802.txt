Mel Joins the Battle! Lightning Girl
ナレーション: Having just returned from questing with Kazuma and party, Mel was in good spirits.
mel: Hehe, what fun that quest was! And it paid pretty well, too!
kazuma: FUN? Taking a lightning bolt to the spine mid-quest isn't what I'd call fun!
mel: You're the one who told me that chaos is a step stool. It helped our cause, didn't it? 
mel: I got the monsters too!
darkness: We slew more giant toads than usual, true. But the quest itself was not, um...pleasant.
megumin: That's putting it lightly. The trap hole Mel dug was way too wide.
megumin: Plus, she hid our weapons. It was terrible.
aqua: *Sob* I was so close to not getting slimed today—
aqua: Until I fell in that hole... 
aqua: I couldn't escape that confounded toad!
mel: It seems you all enjoyed yourselves. 
mel: I'm glad.
kazuma: She doesn't get it. Like, at all...
kazuma: Listen, Mel. No more pranks during quests. 
kazuma: EVER!
mel: Y-You can't be serious!
kazuma: If you can't abstain from pranks, we'll just have to abstain from including you in our party.
mel: ...Oh, fine. I'll stop. 
mel: Anything to go on quests with my dear friends.
mel: There's nothing like working together to overcome hardships in the field. An adventurer's life is the life for me!
darkness: Wow. She accepted, and with hardly any pushback. 
darkness: I guess her love of questing trumps all.
mel: Yes, and while we're discussing quests, I propose we take this one next!
megumin: Huh? But we just came back!
mel: And now we can leave! Come on, gang!
aqua: H-Hey! 
aqua: You're yanking my arm off! 
aqua: Can't I at least shower first?
ナレーション: Ultimately, Mel took the party questing...again and again and again.
