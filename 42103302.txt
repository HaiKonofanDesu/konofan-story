A Great Wizard - P2
Great Wizard: Grrrrrrrrr...
erica: Ahhhhhh!
cielo: Erika!
kazuma: You okay?!
erica: ...Huh. It would seem I am. Could this be it—
erica: the love spell?
erica: Has love grasped this cute, innocent maiden's heart? They say love amplifies a woman's beauty... 
erica: Well, can you tell?
lia: Well, how do you feel? Try out Kazuma. 
lia: You might see him in a different light.
erica: Kazuma...?
kazuma: Do you need me by your side? Do I appear even more suave than usual?
erica: Ugh. Nah. Same old Kazuma.
kazuma: Seriously?
erica: Hehe, did you get your hopes up? Even Kazuma can't resist this singer's adorable cuteness. 
erica: Oh, I truly am amazing. 
erica: Bad girl, Erika, bad—using the hearts of men as your own personal playthings. 
erica: I know, I know. I'm just too cute! 
erica: Stop me!
cielo: Erika, calm down. No one said anything to elicit such a reaction. 
erica: Just look! I'm so cute, I'm absolutely glowing! Let your adoring gazes rain upon me and shower me with praise!
lia: Well, you're certainly more energetic.
cielo: Could this by an effect of the wizard's magic...? Aaah!
cielo: 　　　　
cielo: 　
Great Wizard: Grrrrrrrrr...
kazuma: Crap. I totally forgot—we're in the middle of a quest!
lia: It's too dangerous to fool around anymore. We must defeat it at once!
kazuma: Cielo, are you alright? 
cielo: N-Not a scratch on me. But, strange... When I look at you, my heart starts to race. And my cheeks feel like hot coals.
kazuma: Cielo...? No. Way.
kazuma: Eyes deep as wells. Cheeks with a gentle tinge of rose. Breath reduced to light gasps. Is she...in love?!
lia: Are you really okay? You seem out of breath...
cielo: D-Don't worry. It's nothing at all. Really.
kazuma: You've just sustained an attack. Don't push yourself. 
kazuma: Here, rest easy and take my ha—
cielo: G-Get baaaaaaaaack!
kazuma: A
kazuma: aaaaargh! 
kazuma: I didn't even touch you!
cielo: Back, I saaaaaaaaay!
kazuma: Hwoo
kazuma: rmph!
lia: Th-That was a devastating combo.
kazuma: Agh! 
kazuma: Oomgh! Don't just stand there, help— Mrrrmph?
cielo: Get! Him! Awaaaaaaaaay!
lia: K-Kazuma!
erica: *Whimper* C'mon, Lia, stop showering Kazuma with attention 
erica: and look at ME for once. 
lia: Oh no. Something's wrong with Erika too! I don't think I've ever seen her this hysterical. 
lia: Wait a sec. Hysterical...
lia: Erika said the wizard's spells "make the heart race." That much is true—it sends the target into hysteria!
kazuma: THAT'S what it is? Ya gotta be kidding me! 
kazuma: ...Urrmf!
kazuma: 　
lia: Cielo, you'll kill him!
erica: You're paying attention to everyone but me! Look at me! 
erica: From this angle, and this angle, 
erica: From this angle, and this angle, 
erica: and of course this one!
erica: Well? Aren't I the cutest?!
lia: Erika, please! This is hardly the time!
cielo: Leave me alooooooooone!
kazuma: I should have never come on this quest...
