Breaking Limits For this Weak Adventurer - P2
ナレーション: A troop of Bro-rillas suddenly appeared and forced Kazuma into a grueling weight-lifting program...
kazuma_swimwear: Pain, pain, oh the pain...! My arms might disengage from my torso! 
kazuma_swimwear: Nrrrf!
cielo_swimwear: Hold on, Kazuma!
lia_swimwear: This'll put 'em away!
Bro-rillas: Waaargh!
aqua_swimwear: That's that. 
aqua_swimwear: You still alive, Kazuma?
kazuma_swimwear: *Pant pant* Muscles...in tatters... I'm spent.
megumin_swimwear: That rock they made you carry was no joke.
erica_swimwear: What'd you say again? "No exercise for me—none!" 
erica_swimwear: How'd that turn out for you?
kazuma_swimwear: Damn. I shouldn't have opened my big mouth.
cielo_swimwear: Hmm...
darkness_swimwear: Something up, Cielo?
cielo_swimwear: Kazuma, let's do one more set for good measure. After that, a small break. 
cielo_swimwear: Then we move on to back and shoulders!
kazuma_swimwear: Wha...?!
cielo_swimwear: You look so weak and spongy, the Bro-rillas couldn't help but train you! 
cielo_swimwear: Let's capitalize on this moment!
kazuma_swimwear: Wait, why're you my personal trainer all of a sudden?
lia_swimwear: Seeing the Bro-rillas in action must have triggered her inner coach. 
erica_swimwear: And once Cielo gets going, she doesn't stop. 
erica_swimwear: You may as well give in. 
kazuma_swimwear: This is NOT the happy ending to this ordeal I envisioned!
cielo_swimwear: Less talking, more training! 
cielo_swimwear: Here, cream puff, hold this!
kazuma_swimwear: Grrrnnnmgh! 
kazuma_swimwear: So, so heavy...!
cielo_swimwear: Lift that pebble. Ten times.
kazuma_swimwear: I'm spent just holding the thing. Even once is impossi—
cielo_swimwear: So, we got us a back talker, eh? Make that twenty. 
kazuma_swimwear: Sweet mother molasses!
megumin_swimwear: She's determined to make a man out of him. 
darkness_swimwear: Yeah. 
darkness_swimwear: To be personally brutalized by Cielo must bring him a joy I can't begin to fathom.
aqua_swimwear: Enough about that. Anyone else hungry? 
aqua_swimwear: Let's rustle up some grub already.
erica_swimwear: I second that motion! Lunchtime, people!
lia_swimwear: We'll catch you two later, okay?
kazuma_swimwear: For the love of all that's good and decent—take me with you!
cielo_swimwear: Oh no you don't! After arms, it's shoulders. 
cielo_swimwear: Then we move on to your back! 
cielo_swimwear: It's an all-day program! 
kazuma_swimwear: You gotta be kidding me!
kazuma_swimwear: I can't even move my pinky. Just put me out of my misery. 
erica_swimwear: Pokey poke.
kazuma_swimwear: Yow! 
kazuma_swimwear: Stop poking my leg!
cielo_swimwear: I'm sorry, Kazuma. I had no idea some light training would, er, completely destroy you.
darkness_swimwear: Kazuma, describe your aches! Maybe I can feel it too then...
aqua_swimwear: Why not make this the first day of your journey to a bodybuilder's physique?
megumin_swimwear: No, I don't think he'd look good all big and buff. Which is why, Kazuma, 
megumin_swimwear: you should study the explosive arts with me!
kazuma_swimwear: Wait, you don't think I would look good ripped? Then why I have endured this TORTURE?
cielo_swimwear: I may have gone a little overboard. Sorry about that. 
cielo_swimwear: How about I make amends—by training you next week, too?!
kazuma_swimwear: I don't plan to train next week. Or the week after that. Or after that. 
kazuma_swimwear: Or ever again. I wanted peace, but only got pain. Ugh.
ナレーション: Terrified of another surprise workout session, Kazuma avoided Cielo for some time after...
