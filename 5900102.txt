Legendary Adventurer Festival
kazuma_fest: Now THIS is adventurer's garb! 
kazuma_fest: Does anyone else feel like going on a quest?!
darkness_fest: Kazuma wants to go on a quest? I think that proves these outfits are working.
aqua_fest: They better be. I poured my heart and soul into them. You're welcome, by the way.
kazuma_fest: Yeah, thanks, Aqua! I've endured untold ridicule for my feeble job class. 
kazuma_fest: But no more—not looking like this!
kazuma_fest: And so begins the legend of Kazuma Satou, legendary adventurer! 
kazuma_fest: Ah, I can hear them now. 
kazuma_fest: The cries of those in need of a hero!
darkness_fest: Really? I can't hear a thing.
kazuma_fest: Fear not, ye innocent souls. 
kazuma_fest: For I feel that now, not even the Devil King could stop me!
kazuma_fest: To me, comrades! We ride!
aqua_fest: Wow, Kazuma! Honestly, I'd given up hope on defeating the Devil King. 
aqua_fest: Now I say, let's take it to him!
darkness_fest: Hey, Kazuma, Aqua! 
darkness_fest: They ran off. Boy were they excited.
darkness_fest: Are they going to be okay, though? Aqua said she made these outfits out of scrap wood and milk cartons.
ナレーション: Utterly immersed in the spirit of adventure, Kazuma fought harder than he ever had before...
