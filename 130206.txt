Negotiations with This Magic Item Researcher! P6
Lady Golems: Depositing...trash in receptacle!
kazuma: Whoa! 
kazuma: They're STILL going?! 
iris_adventurer: Brother!
darkness: They're all going for Kazuma, how unfair! 
darkness: I'm right here! Attack me, golems! Please!! 
kazuma: Less talk, more help. PLEASE!!!
Lady Golem: Broth...er...? No—masterrrrrr!
megumin: I'm sensing the golems think Kazuma is their master. 
aqua: Doesn't Kazuma always gripe about how he wants a maid? I'm happy for you, Kazuma! 
kazuma: Why do you always just watch from the sidelines when I'm fighting for my life! This isn't a free movie! 
Lady Golem: Terminating target... 
kazuma: Oh crud. Will one of you PLEASE—
iris_adventurer: Stop right there! Haaaaaah!
Lady Golems: Aghhhhhh...!
megumin: Huh? Was that Iris's...?
darkness: Extellion?! 
darkness: Princess, has your memory returned? 
iris_adventurer: Uh, um... Hmm... 
kazuma: You saved me, Iris! 
kazuma: That was a close one... 
aqua: Those golems are toast, all thanks to Iris's 
aqua: ballistic firepower!
iris_adventurer: My hands are still numb. I'd no idea I possessed such a skill. 
darkness: So your memory 
darkness: has yet to return?
iris_adventurer: I don't believe so. The skill seemed to burst out of me without my will. 
kazuma: I see. That's too bad... 
kazuma: But regardless, we have you to thank for taking out those golems, you adventurer!
iris_adventurer: Y-You're too kind! 
iris_adventurer: Glad to be of service!
megumin: Now we can finally get that magic item off of Shelly. Then your memory will be back for good. 
iris_adventurer: Back...for good. 
aqua: A happy ending, eh, Iris? 
iris_adventurer: ... 
kazuma: It's still a happy ending, Iris. Just because you get your memory back, doesn't mean we won't adventure together. You're a part of our party now. 
iris_adventurer: You're right, it's not goodbye for good! Thanks, Kazuma. 
aqua: Shelly! We got rid of those golems just like you asked!
kazuma: Odd. Where'd she go? If she's off writing more smut novels, 
kazuma: I swear... 
iris_adventurer: Smut? 
kazuma: Oh, uhhh. Don't mind, just muttering to myself. 
darkness: Something's not right. The door was wide open.
？？？: Nnngh... 
megumin: Wait—who was that? 
iris_adventurer: Shelly, if you're there, we're coming in! 
shelly: Urrrngh... 
kazuma: Oh no, Shelly?! What happened to you? 
darkness: The place has been turned inside out. 
megumin: Aqua, we could use a Heal! 
aqua: Coming right up! 
aqua: Heal! 
shelly: Argh! Back, you intruder! What business have you with me?! 
iris_adventurer: It's me. Has your memory left you too? 
kazuma: No. Just her vision. Her glasses are on the floor. 
shelly: Hm? Let's see now... 
shelly: Kazuma? And Princess Iris too!
aqua: How are you feeling? We found you passed out. 
darkness: What in the world happened? 
shelly: I can't say how long I was out for, 
shelly: but what I can say is the mansion was hit by thieves.
kazuma: Thieves? 
kazuma: But you're the "Swordmaster." Aren't you supposed to be like, super strong?
shelly: B-But of course. No living being can best me with a blade. 
shelly: On this particular occasion, however... 
iris_adventurer: Miss Shelly? 
shelly: Growing tired from my research, I removed my glasses to take a nap. In that very moment, they struck. 
shelly: I was blind and vulnerable. 
darkness: I see. What conniving thieves. 
aqua: So you didn't manage to catch a glimpse of them? 
Lady Golem: Graaaah! Masterrrrrr!
shelly: No, but I did recognize their voices. 
kazuma: Golems? But what would golems want with you?
shelly: Uh oh! H-Hold on. 
shelly: I need to check on something real quick.
shelly: This drawer. And this drawer. This one too—no way! 
shelly: ARGHHHH! My precious magic items! Every last one! Stolen! 
shelly: The safe's been cleaned out too!
megumin: They bashed the door right in. 
shelly: O-Oh calamity! And the memory-restoring item was among those stolen wares!
kazuma: N-No way! 
kazuma: They took that too?! 
iris_adventurer: O-Oh no... 
ナレーション: Kazuma and friends stood dumbstruck in the ransacked room. Their one means to recover Iris's memory was gone.
