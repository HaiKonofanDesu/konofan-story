Yunyun - P2
ynyn: Megumin sure is in a good mood today... And that food looks delicious...
ナレーション: One evening, Yunyun was hiding behind a pillar in the tavern, staring jealously at everyone enjoying their meals.
megumin: Ooh! It's boiling! It's boiling!
darkness: That smell makes me so hungry... Is it ready yet?
ynyn: A-are they having a...hotpot party?
ynyn: A group of friends gathered around a pot of yummy stew... I'd heard rumors, but never seen one in person!
kazuma: Okay, I'll give it a taste and see if it's ready. 
kazuma: Just a small sip... *Slurp slurp* 
kazuma: Yuuum! The broth is super tasty!
aqua: No fair, Kazuma! 
aqua: Let me try too! With some ponzu!
darkness: I'll dish it up for you. Careful though, it's hot.
aqua: *Slurp slurp* 
aqua: Mmm! I give it three stars!
megumin: Ah, it really warms your body and soul!
ynyn: Having a dinner party with your good friends... Definitely not jealous or anything...
ynyn: I was just passing by and happened to see them!
ynyn: Oh, hi Megumin! That's an awfully big pot of stew you've got. If you can't finish it, I'd be happy to help!
megumin: Oh, if it isn't Yunyun. We'll be able to eat all this no problem, so don't worry about us.
ynyn: Urgh... W-well, in that case... 
ynyn: I'd say it's time we settled our long-standing score!
megumin: Nah. I'm not really up for it...
ynyn: Don't say that! Pleeeaaase?
kazuma: Yo, Megumin. Want seconds?
megumin: Yes, please!
ynyn: Hey! I'm challenging you over here! Stop staring at your food and look at me!
aqua: Oh, hey Yunyun. Still feuding with Megumin?
megumin: Yeah, she's nothing but trouble, as always.
ynyn: What? I'm not going to lose to someone who refuses quests to sit around and party with her friends!
megumin: Fine, fine. We can have our contest after I'm done eating.\n
megumin: *Munch munch*
ynyn: C-can you stop eating for a minute? It won't take long... I'll even throw in a skill potion, too!
darkness: See how badly she wants this? Why won't you just accept her challenge?
megumin: *Sigh* You're really hopeless, you know that? Fine, what am I going to beat you in?
ynyn: Th-thank you, Megumin!
ynyn: I suppose it's too dangerous to fire off spells here. 
ynyn: In that case... We can arm wrestle!
megumin: Sounds good, that food gave me some pep. So you'll give me a skill potion if I win, right?
ynyn: O-of course. But if I win...
ynyn: Y-You... Um... You...
megumin: What is it? Spit it out already.
ynyn: Umm, y-you'll...you'll let me...
megumin: I get it. You want me to teach you something, do you?
ynyn: Huh?
megumin: I can do that! I'll tell you everything you want to know about the wonders of explosion magic!
ynyn: Th-that's not what I was trying to say!
megumin: You don't want to know more about the world's most powerful attack magic? What kind of demon are you?
ynyn: Rrgh! Megumin, listen to me!
ynyn: If I win... I-if I w-win... 
ynyn: *Deep breath* 
ynyn: You'll let me join your p-p-p-party!
kazuma: I just added the rice!
aqua: Mmm, this is delicious! 
aqua: Here you are, Megumin.
megumin: Thank you... 
megumin: *Slurp slurp slurp*
ynyn: Huh? Is... Is it all...gone?
darkness: Sorry, but Kazuma finished it off. You can have some broth and rice if you like.
ynyn: Ah... Aaagh!
megumin: What's wrong? Better eat up before it gets cold. We can have our contest after you—
ynyn: I give up. Here's your skill potion.
megumin: Huh? But we haven't had our contest. Are you sure?
ynyn: I don't care anymore...
ynyn: I guess me sitting down to a dinner party with everyone is still nothing more than a dream...
megumin: Whoa! Hold up, Yunyun!
megumin: ...Victory!
ynyn: Waaaaaah! I just wanted to party with everyone!
ナレーション: The next evening, Yunyun had a hotpot party all by herself.
