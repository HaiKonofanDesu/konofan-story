OVERLORD Collaboration P1 
kazuma_O: Bwahahaha! This is amazing! 
kazuma_O: I feel like 
kazuma_O: I could conquer the world! 
darkness_O: Th-Th-This outfit is just too embarrassing! 
darkness_O: I can barely stand the shame. 
albedo: Why are you embarrassed? It's actually rather fitting. 
ainz: She's right. Is Aqua a professional tailor? 
ainz: The quality is far too high for an amateur.
kazuma_O: I don't disagree. 
albedo: I hope I'm wrong, but that sounded like you were trying to imitate Lord Ainz. 
kazuma_O: ... 
kazuma_O: I don't disagree.
albedo: How disgraceful. 
albedo: Shall I punish him, my lord? 
ainz: Calm yourself. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. 
darkness_O: A-Albedo, how is it you can stand to 
darkness_O: wear such an indecent outfit every day? 
albedo: It's simple of course! 
albedo: For my beloved Lord Ainz. 
albedo: As his primary wife, I must always maintain my appearances. 
darkness_O: Primary wife? In other words, his first wife? 
darkness_O: D-D-Doesn't that mean he has at least two wives?! 
kazuma_O: What?! You have get to have multiple wives?! 
kazuma_O: But you're undead! That's no fair! 
ainz: Well... 
ainz: Actually, Albedo just likes to call herself my wife. 
albedo: Lord Ainz is destined to rule the world! 
albedo: It is only natural that he would have multiple wives! 
darkness_O: D-Does that mean...
darkness_O: what I think it means?! 
darkness_O: Every night, this undead skeleton, your lord, visits your 
darkness_O: bedroom and ties you up and uses his slimy tentacles on you?!
albedo: Indeed. 
darkness_O: Incredible! 
ainz: L-Lies! 
ainz: And since when do I 
ainz: have tentacles, anyway?!
kazuma_O: Umm... Please excuse my truly disturbed friend for her wild imagination.
