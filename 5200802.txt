Starry Arabian Nights
chris_arabian: All right, let's see. According to my source, the treasure 
chris_arabian: we're looking for should be right up ahead.
dust_arabian: All this sneakin' around isn't my style.\n
dust_arabian: Can't we make a bigger show of this or something?
chris_arabian: What are you talking about? I'm not some lowly burglar! 
chris_arabian: I'm a refined thief who prides herself on stealth.
dust_arabian: You don't look like one in that outfit. I mean seriously, 
dust_arabian: what's with these clothes, anyway?
chris_arabian: My assistant—
chris_arabian: I mean, Kazuma made them for me. He said they would be perferct for infiltrating a mansion in the desert.
dust_arabian: So it's like a disguise, then? To be honest, I'd prefer my normal clothes.
chris_arabian: You were the one who insisted on coming, so quit complaining and 
chris_arabian: do as you're told!
dust_arabian: Fine, fine. I guess I can let you lead if it means gettin' 
dust_arabian: our hands on the treasure we came for... 
dust_arabian: A magic lamp with a djinn inside that'll grant any wish... 
dust_arabian: I still doubt it's real, but I can't pass up the chance!
dust_arabian: Should I be a king? Or maybe I'll ask for a beautiful woman to feed me a never-ending supply of food and bubbly! 
dust_arabian: Hehehe!
chris_arabian: Not so fast, Dust. I already explained this. We can split 
chris_arabian: the rest of it, but the lamp belongs to me.
dust_arabian: Oh, don't be stingy. I'm sure we can both enjoy it. If the 
dust_arabian: stories are true, we can wish for anything we want.
chris_arabian: No way. You're just going to ask for something weird.
dust_arabian: Have a little faith in me. I'd start with world peace first, and then maybe...
dust_arabian: I mean, MAYBE after that, some women and money...
chris_arabian: ...
chris_arabian: Looks like we found the place.
dust_arabian: Man, that lock-picking ability of yours sure is handy.
chris_arabian: I don't even want to imagine how you'd abuse it. 
chris_arabian: Anyway, let's see if we can find that lamp.
dust_arabian: Hm? Is this it right here?
chris_arabian: Oh! Nicely done, Dust! Now grab it and we can 
chris_arabian: get out of here!
dust_arabian: Hold on. Let's test it once to see if the rumors are true!
chris_arabian: Dust! What are you doing?! If a djinn really does pop out of that thing—
dust_arabian: Then my every desire shall become reality! Let's do this!
dust_arabian: 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
chris_arabian: Noooooo!!! 
chris_arabian: Wait, huh?
dust_arabian: Nothing's happening... 
dust_arabian: No, wait!
dust_arabian: M-My mouth is starting to itch! What's going on?! Something 
dust_arabian: feels wrong with my mouth! Do something, Chris!
chris_arabian: Your gums look really swollen, 
chris_arabian: like you've got gingivitis. 
dust_arabian: I thought you said a djinn was supposed to appear!
chris_arabian: Djinn... Gingivitis...
chris_arabian: Huh. I guess that does explain why it was so easy to find. 
chris_arabian: There's no djinn in that lamp. It's a cursed object that gives you gingivitis!
dust_arabian: What?! You're joking, right?! AAAHHHHHH!!!\n
dust_arabian: I can't stand it! My whole mouth hurts now!
chris_arabian: That's what you get for trying to steal the lamp from me. 
chris_arabian: You'll just have to ask Aqua to use some healing magic.
dust_arabian: Yeeaahh... Good idea. 
dust_arabian: Hopefully I can find her before my teeth fall out!
chris_arabian: Hehe. This is a good lesson, I suppose—dreams are meant to be obtained through hard work, not some magical djinn.
dust_arabian: Oh shut it! I won't let something like this stop me!
ナレーション: Dust had to go three days before Aqua was available. Fortunately, he didn't lose any teeth.
