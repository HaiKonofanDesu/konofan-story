Sightseeing in This Pitiful City! - P2
kazuma: Drain Touch!
darkness: Ngh!
ナレーション: Kazuma sucked energy from Darkness and poured it into Wiz...
wiz: Ngh... Ngh... 
wiz: Huh? ...Where am I?
kazuma: We're at the inn in Arcanretia. You're looking better.
wiz: Um... Where's Lady Aqua?
darkness: She went to the Order's headquarters. Probably to bask in their adoration while she's in town.
kazuma: I'm worried. Like, super worried.
darkness: I'm sure she'll be fine. Besides, Megumin is with her.
wiz: Thank you for looking after me. I'm feeling much better now, so why don't you two go do some sightseeing?
darkness: What a splendid idea. There are many sights I'd like to take in while we're here.
darkness: Look, Kazuma! A fountain! It's so beautiful... That statue... It's of the goddess, is it not? It's breathtaking!
kazuma: Since this is the Axis Order's HQ... That statue's gotta be of Aqua, right? 
kazuma: It looks nothing like her.
Woman: Ahh! My apples...
kazuma: Are you okay? Let me help you with those.
Woman: Why, thank you. You're too kind.
Woman: That was so nice of you. Um... Is there any way I can...repay you?
kazuma: Hmm... Something doesn't seem right here...
Woman: The Order has this nice little cafe down the road. How about we go there and have a chat?
kazuma: N-No, thanks.
Woman: Don't walk away! I'm a gifted fortuneteller!
kazuma: I-I'm okay! Seriously, I'm not interested!\n
kazuma: Let... Let go of me!
Woman: Your fortune is clear! A dark cloud will soon be over you! You can avoid it if you join the Order of Axis!
Woman: Join us! Join us and be saved!
kazuma: There's a dark cloud clinging onto me right now! L-Let go! 
kazuma: Darkness! Gimme a hand here!
darkness: Excuse me. I am a member of the Eris faith. You mean to convert that man, but he has refused, so—
Woman: *Spit*
darkness: *Gasp*
kazuma: Really? That was enough to get you going?
Man: Congratulations! You're the millionth person to walk down this avenue!
Man: We would like to present you with a special prize, sponsored by the Order of Axis!
Man: All you have to do to claim your reward is sign this paper! Well? What do you say?
kazuma: ...
Young Woman: Hm? Hey! It's been forever! Remember me? How've you been?
Young Woman: We were classmates! Don't tell me you forgot! Then again, I changed quite a bit after joining the Order of Axis...
Young Woman: Ohhh, I get it—you're part of the Eris faith... Pft!
darkness: ...
Older Woman: What do we have here? Newlyweds? You two have much learn. Here, have some soap!
Older Woman: Consider it a gift. I don't need a single Eris. This detergent's something else, I tell you!
Older Woman: It was blessed by Lady Aqua, so it will make your skin silky smooth, with no bodily side effects, I swear!
Older Woman: You can even drink it!
kazuma: What is with this town?! Is everyone in the Order of Axis insane?
kazuma: I can't take another solicitor. Let's just head back to the inn.
Girl: Lalalalalala... ♪
Girl: Uh oh.
kazuma: Are you okay?!
Girl: Oww... It hurts!
darkness: Stop crying just because you fell down. Now show me where it hurts.
kazuma: Looks like just a scrape.
Girl: Thank you, sir, ma'am!
kazuma: Ah... Even in a town full of lunatics, at least there's one little girl with a pure heart.
kazuma: Okay, can you stand?
Girl: Yeah, I'm all better now. I like you—you're nice. 
Girl: What's your name?
kazuma: My name's Kazuma. Kazuma Satou.\n
kazuma: And this scary lady is Darkness.
darkness: D-Don't introduce me like that!\n
darkness: Do I really look that scary...?
Girl: Ahahaha!
Girl: Kazuma Satou... How's that spelled? Can you write it on this piece of paper for me?
kazuma: Sure, it looks like—
kazuma: Huh?!
darkness: What's wrong, Kazu— 
darkness: Huh?!
kazuma: Th-This is an...Order of Axis...registration form.\n
kazuma: So even this little girl is...
axis_girl: What's the matter? Quickly, tell me—
kazuma: Grrraaagh!
kazuma: Curse this damn place!!
axis_girl: Sir, pleeeeease!
kazuma: Using an innocent little girl like that for their scam...\n
kazuma: Aqua's gotta do something about her followers!
ナレーション: Quivering with anger, Kazuma went with Darkness to the Axis Order headquarters...
