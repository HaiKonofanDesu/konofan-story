A Present on This Holy Night! P5
ナレーション: The search for Christmas reindeer continued as Kazuma and company neared the mountain's peak...
aqua_winter: I can't go any further! Can we at least rest a minute?!
darkness_christmas: I agree. This blizzard is terrible for visibility. It may be best to wait it out.
banil_christmas: Very well. 
banil_christmas: Reindeer may be ferocious, but they rarely cause of any deaths. I believe you now understand why.
kazuma_winter: In other words, they're rare enough that people don't usually run into them?
ynyn_christmas: Not finding any despite Kazuma's Luck stat must mean that they're quite rare indeed.
megumin_christmas: Either that or his luck is so high that it's saving him from encountering such a ferocious beast.
aqua_winter: So it's Kazuma's fault we're not finding any reindeer?!
kazuma_winter: I'd rather you not make it sound like this is my doing.
banil_christmas: What's this? I thought you needed to rest. If you've got this much energy, let us forgo the break and get moving.
kazuma_winter: I'm sorry. Please, let us rest here for a while.
ynyn_christmas: E-Everyone! 
ynyn_christmas: I thought that this might happen, so I brought something just in case!
kazuma_winter: Wow! I thought that pack of yours looked a bit heavy. 
kazuma_winter: You carried lunch all the way up here?
aqua_winter: And enough for everyone, too!
megumin_christmas: A tribute, huh? You sure went out of your way to prepare.
ynyn_christmas: N-No, it's nothing like that! 
ynyn_christmas: I just happened to have some leftovers and decided to bring them!
darkness_christmas: The thought is appreciated nonetheless. Thank you.
banil_christmas: We're actually resting? What a bore. 
banil_christmas: I did not realize you were all so weak that even my walking pace was too much.
aqua_winter: Hey! I'm not about to let that one slide!
kazuma_winter: Aqua, how many times are you two going to fight today? Just ignore him already, will—
aqua_winter: You will apologize this instant for calling me weak!
banil_christmas: You mean for telling the truth? 
banil_christmas: You're clearly exhausted. Please rest while I go on ahead, you worthless goddess.
aqua_winter: Excuse me?! I have more than enough energy to keep going!
kazuma_winter: You were the one whining, saying you couldn't go any further. Do you really need to show off this badly?
aqua_winter: Shut up! I am a goddess, and we absolutely never give up!
darkness_christmas: Aqua, where are you going?!
aqua_winter: That's obvious! I'm going to find these reindeer before this fiendish demon does!
banil_christmas: Mwahahaha! 
banil_christmas: How amusing! I accept your challenge!
ynyn_christmas: They actually left... 
ynyn_christmas: D-Do you think they'll be all right?
kazuma_winter: Just leave 'em alone. They'll be back once they cool off in this blizzard. 
kazuma_winter: Come on, let's have some hot tea.
megumin_christmas: They still haven't returned...
ynyn_christmas: Do you think we should go look for them?
kazuma_winter: No, if we leave now, we're likely to miss each other and—
darkness_christmas: Shh! Quiet! Do you hear that?
megumin_christmas: Something's rumbling.
ynyn_christmas: The shaking is getting stronger! 
？？？: Aaaaaahhhhhh!!!
kazuma_winter: Is that...
kazuma_winter: Aqua?!
Reindeer: Grrraaaaaargh!
darkness_christmas: K-Kazuma, look! Behind Aqua!
kazuma_winter: What the heck are those things?! They're huge and kicking up a huge cloud of snow! 
kazuma_winter: Don't tell me—
megumin_christmas: It's a herd of reindeer!
ynyn_christmas: Aqua actually found them!
kazuma_winter: That's great and all, but why's it gotta be a whole herd?! 
kazuma_winter: Damn! I forgot to take her awful Luck into account!
aqua_winter: W
aqua_winter: aaaaaahhh!!! Make them stoooooop!!!
Reindeer: Grrraaaaaargh!
kazuma_winter: Why are they so angry?!
darkness_christmas: Hey, look over there!
Reindeer Boss: Graaaaaargh!
kazuma_winter: Those things are terrifying! Are they really reindeer?!
darkness_christmas: If I were to get trampled by such a beast... 
darkness_christmas: What do you think would become of me?!
banil_christmas: You would obviously be crushed.
kazuma_winter: Vanir, good timing! 
kazuma_winter: I wasn't expecting to deal with an entire herd! What's the plan?! Do we run?!
banil_christmas: Nonsense! The phony goddess angered them by trespassing in their territory, 
banil_christmas: but a rampaging beast is easy to predict.
banil_christmas: Once I have demonstrated my strength to these reindeer, I shall be able to tame these beasts.
aqua_winter: Help me, 
aqua_winter: Kazumaaaaaaaaa!!!
Reindeer Boss: Graaaaaargh!
kazuma_winter: Why do things always turn out like this?! 
kazuma_winter: Come on, everyone! We've got some reindeer to fight!
