megumin_swimwear: It's all on you, Aqua!
darkness_swimwear: Make the next shot count!
aqua_swimwear: You bet! Axel Hearts, prepare to witness the awesome might of Explosion Goddess Lalatina! 
aqua_swimwear: Haaaaaagh!
cielo_swimwear: She's winding up. This next one's sure to be a real doozy! Erika, Lia, back me up!
lia_swimwear: Gotcha. If they score one more time it's over for us!
erica_swimwear: G-Guys, it's just a game, c'mon! I'm pooped. 
erica_swimwear: Not to mention thirsty too!
aqua_swimwear: God Serve! The unlucky fool who receives this serve...SHALL DIE!
Axel Hearts: Nooooooooo!
ナレーション: A light sea breeze danced over an ivory beach...where the girls were engaged in a tense volleyball match! Meanwhile—
kazuma_swimwear: *Slurp* Nothing beats a cool drink on the beach... And swimsuit-clad girls. And me, lazing away. Life is good.
erica_swimwear: Hey, Kazuma! Don't hog the juice! Gimme a glass!
cielo_swimwear: Kazuma, switch out with someone already. The beach is best enjoyed on your feet!
kazuma_swimwear: Oh, I insist—allow me to be the martyr and watch over everyone's 
kazuma_swimwear: stuff. Is the volleyball game over already?
cielo_swimwear: Yep. Thanks to Lia, we managed to end it in a tie. 
erica_swimwear: I helped too! Like, a lot! In fact, I think I deserve 
erica_swimwear: another glass of juice. Whaddaya say...?
kazuma_swimwear: Sorry, one per person. It's such a hassle to go buy more. 
erica_swimwear: Ugh, you're such a cheapo. And a couch potato. 
erica_swimwear: We both know watching our bags is just an excuse to be lazy.
cielo_swimwear: She has a point, Kazuma. All this lounging about will make you out of shape. 
kazuma_swimwear: Eh. Who cares? 
kazuma_swimwear: See, when I come to the beach, I come to do one thing and one thing only: nothing.
kazuma_swimwear: No matter what you my say, I am going to lounge myself into oblivion! No exercise for me—none!
lia_swimwear: H-He's not budging.
megumin_swimwear: Hey, Aqua. Can teach me that serve you did back there, please?
aqua_swimwear: Be forewarned, it's no novice skill. 
aqua_swimwear: But, since you asked nicely, I suppose I could show you. 
aqua_swimwear: Darkness, help me out.
darkness_swimwear: Give me your best shot! The harder, the better!
kazuma_swimwear: Wow. The gang's extra lively today. 
kazuma_swimwear: *Yaw
kazuma_swimwear: n*
megumin_swimwear: HI-YAAAH! 
megumin_swimwear: ...Uh oh.
kazuma_swimwear: Bl
kazuma_swimwear: rrrmgh?!
erica_swimwear: There's a volleyball-shaped imprint on his face... That's gotta hurt.
cielo_swimwear: Y-You okay there, Kazuma?
megumin_swimwear: Sorry. It appears I don't know my own awe-inspiring strength. 
megumin_swimwear: As well as my lack of coordination. 
kazuma_swimwear: You dare ruin my epic lounging session?! 
kazuma_swimwear: I was hurting no one! But now—no more Mr. Nice Guy!
darkness_swimwear: Hey, why'd you have to go and hurl it so far? 
darkness_swimwear: It's out of sight now.
kazuma_swimwear: Silence! You robbed me of my happiness, so I robbed you of your ball. All's fair!
Bro-rillas: Grrroooaaarrr!
erica_swimwear: Aaahhh! A m-m-monster!
megumin_swimwear: It's a troop of 
megumin_swimwear: Bro-rillas!
Bro-rilla A: Ooh-ooh! Ooh-hoo?
aqua_swimwear: One of them's got something... 
aqua_swimwear: Hey, it's our ball! You think he'll give it back?
Bro-rilla A: Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!
cielo_swimwear: I would guess not? He seems angry.
erica_swimwear: Well, yeah. Probably because Kazuma beaned him with it.
kazuma_swimwear: Can't be. They'd attack if that were the case. 
kazuma_swimwear: Either way, this standoff needs to come to a quick and peaceful end—
Bro-rilla A: Ooh! Ooh-ooh!
kazuma_swimwear: What in the 
kazuma_swimwear: actual heck?! 
kazuma_swimwear: Lemme go, ya oversized simian!
ナレーション: The creatures examined Kazuma up and down, and eventually handed a large rock to their captive.
kazuma_swimwear: H-Hey, 
kazuma_swimwear: this thing's heavy! Take it back!
Bro-rilla A: Rrroooarngh!
kazuma_swimwear: This is ridiculous! 
kazuma_swimwear: I don't need a rock, especially not one this heavy!
megumin_swimwear: Uh... Does anyone know what's going on?
cielo_swimwear: The monsters seem strangely satisfied... 
cielo_swimwear: Wait—they're 
cielo_swimwear: training him! My father did this with me all the time!
aqua_swimwear: They saw the weakest, most pitiful out of 
aqua_swimwear: all of us, and couldn't help but train the feeble oaf.
Bro-rilla A: Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo! Oooh...hoo!
kazuma_swimwear: This is DARN 
kazuma_swimwear: heavy! 
kazuma_swimwear: My arms are about to detach!
darkness_swimwear: Kazuma, you okay? 
darkness_swimwear: Oh dear! I'd love to take your pain from you!
kazuma_swimwear: Stop your masochistic jabbering 
kazuma_swimwear: and help me already!
cielo_swimwear: W-We're on it, Kazuma! Hang in there!
