And so the Adventure Begins!
？？？: Welcome to the afterlife.
？？？: Unfortunately, you passed away moments ago. Your life was a short one...but you are, in fact, dead.
aqua: My name is Aqua. I'm a goddess who guides those who die young to the afterlife.
aqua: You have two choices. Start over with a new life, or move on to heaven.
aqua: But...you like games, right? You were a shut-in gamer during your life in Japan, after all.
aqua: There's a world that's being threatened by the Devil King's army. I can send you there with your body and soul intact.
aqua: You say there'd be no point in going if you'll die anyway? 
aqua: Hehe! You won't go empty-handed! 
aqua: I'll allow you the right to bring one thing with you to the other world.
aqua: It could be a powerful item, a special talent, anything you can think of!
aqua: Now, choose! I'll grant you one, indomitable power!
aqua: No matter what you pick, it's all the same. I'm not expecting much from a shut-in NEET.
aqua: Hurry up and choose already... I've got other dead people to... 
aqua: Wait. Did you just say...?
aqua: Huh?! Me?! W-Wait a sec, you can't be serious...
aqua: No way! This isn't right... Taking a goddess with you is against the rules! 
aqua: This isn't fair! I can't beat the Devil King! 
aqua: No! I don't wanna go to another world with a NEET! 
aqua: Nooo!!
kazuma: Man, feels like it was just yesterday...
megumin: What are you smiling about, Kazuma?
kazuma: I was just recalling the day I met Aqua...
darkness: I like to reminisce as well, but don't we have more pressing matters?
kazuma: Do we? Now seems like the perfect time to reminisce, if you ask me.
kazuma: You never truly know what you have until it's gone.\nAqua...was a dear friend.
？？？: Hey, hold on!
？？？: I'm not dead, you hear?! Hurry up and help me!
aqua: It's all warm and slimy and gross in here! It's gonna eat me!
kazuma: Don't worry about me, Aqua. I promise to be strong, even without you by my side.
aqua: You can't just give up on me! Kazumaaaa! Do somethiiiing!
megumin: It's your own fault for getting ahead of yourself and using magic to lure monsters here.
aqua: But if I gathered them all in one place, you could just blow them all up and I wouldn’t have to get close!
darkness: Getting covered in slimy, gooey monster fluids... What a rare, precious experience! 
darkness: N-No fair, Aqua! I deserve such punishment!
aqua: This isn't one of your fantasies—
aqua: Eek?!
aqua: Waaah! Pleeease, Kazumaaaaaa!
kazuma: *Sigh* Fine. 
kazuma: I guess I don't have a choice!
