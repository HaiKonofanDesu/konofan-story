A Harvest Festival for This Northern Land! - P6
squall_samuido: Those who disturb my sleep will pay with their lives! None shall escape my wrath! 
squall_samuido: Graaaaaagh!
chris_samuido: He still hasn't regained his senses. 
chris_samuido: Looks like we have no choice. 
chris_samuido: Let's do this, Kazuma!
kazuma_winter: Right! 
kazuma_winter: One, two, and—!
Kazuma, Chris: Bind!
squall_samuido: Graaah!
kazuma_winter: Aqua, now!
aqua_winter: Create Water!
squall_samuido: Nnngh! So cold! 
squall_samuido: Huh...? Where am I?
chris_samuido: Thank goodness. How are you feeling? 
chris_samuido: Hold on, I'll remove these bindings.
kazuma_winter: What a disaster. Thanks to your little rampage, the contest was put on hold.
squall_samuido: Oh, no... 
squall_samuido: I've made a mess of things. I'm so sorry...
Villager A: You can say that again. Although... It's not as if this is the first time this has happened.
Villager B: That's right. Remember when a spider got on your leg? It took the entire village to subdue you. 
squall_samuido: Please, don't remind me. You have my deepest apologies.
darkness_winter: I didn't know if we could resolve it in time, 
darkness_winter: but I'm relieved we can continue the Gluttonous Dedication.
Amy_samuido: Everyone, come quick! It's Mia!
megumin_winter: Now what happened?!
Amy_samuido: I only took my eyes off her for a moment, but...
miia_samuido: I'm so full... I can't eat another bite...
chris_samuido: Is she...?
Amy_samuido: She snuck away and ate all the meat being sold at the nearby stalls.
kazuma_winter: Even after all those tomatoes and the eating contest? What is she made of? 
kazuma_winter: Isn't...that technically stealing? 
darkness_winter: How are you going to resume the contest if Mia is unable to eat any more?
squall_samuido: That's fine. We will consider it to be a disqualification. 
squall_samuido: I hereby declare Chris to be this year's Grand Vegetal!
chris_samuido: I-I won?!
ナレーション: The Gluttonous Dedication came to a close and the villagers began dancing and making offerings to the Grand Vegetal...
miia_samuido: Everyone, time to show off what we practiced!
Everyone: A 
Everyone: one! 
Everyone: A one! 
Everyone: A one! 
Everyone: A two!
Villager A: Wow! That's the village's dance! 
aqua_winter: I can play the instrument, too! Here, let me show you!
Village Musician: Y-Your tone is so clear and beautiful... Please, show me your ways, teacher!
chris_samuido: Aqua and the others sure look like they're having fun... 
chris_samuido: I kinda wish I could join them.
Village Elder: Grand Vegetal, I'm afraid you have little time for such distractions. You have many responsibilities to uphold. 
chris_samuido: What? I do?
Village Elder: Your first order of business is to greet every member of the village. 
chris_samuido: I understand. 
chris_samuido: Wait, did you say EVERY member?!
Village Elder: Of course. After that, you must cleanse yourself in the river before going—
chris_samuido: Hold on! No one told me about any sort of responsibilities!
darkness: Chris, are you awake? We're planning on playing a board game if you're—
chris: Zzz... Zzz...
kazuma: She's out cold. 
aqua: She did say she couldn't sleep very well last night.
megumin_lightcloth: She was pretty busy greeting people and playing the part of Great Vegetal today as well.
darkness: It's quite commendable to work so hard on her vacation. Still...
chris: Zzz... Zzz... Zzzzzz...
darkness: She looks so peaceful now. Sleep well, Chris.
chris: That was fun... Zzz...
