Lia - P2
lia: *Sigh* I'm exhausted.
ナレーション: Lia had been looking more haggard than usual, and collapsed face-first into bed.
lia: What a week... I really worked my tail off.
ナレーション: A few days earlier...
erica: Why do I have to clean the stage? I'm supposed to be the one standing on it, not sweeping it!
lia: Stop complaining. At least we get to use the stage.
cielo: B-besides, we've got no money. This way, we save on the cleaning bill.
erica: But our costumes will get dirty if we clean in them! 
erica: That's not very cute, and being cute is what I'm all about!
lia: That's not a problem. Our manager gave us clothes to clean in.
erica: You expect me to wear THIS? 
erica: Absolutely not! It's not even remotely cute!
cielo: Erika, dear... Don't be like that.
lia: Erika's selfishness sure is a pain...
ナレーション: On another day...
Female Fan: Cielo, your face is so cute and petite when I see it close up! Can I shake your hand?
cielo: Ahaha! Of course you can. Thank you so much for coming to see us today.
lia: Cielo is good at dealing with our female fans, but...
Male Fan: *Pant pant* Cielo! Shake my hand t—
cielo: Eeeeeek!
lia: Cielo, stop it!
cielo: Augh! I did it again...
lia: I'm so sorry. Are you all right?
Male Fan: I-I'd be lying if I said I was... Cielo's fists...sure pack...a wallop...
lia: M-mister?! Hang in there!
ナレーション: On yet another day...
lia_stage: We're on soon. I need to focus...
cielo_stage: Lia...
lia_stage: Hm? What's the matter?
cielo_stage: I only have 49 pairs of gloves for the meet-and-greet. I can't do this if I don't have 50.
lia_stage: D-does one pair make that big a difference?
erica_stage: Hey, Lia. I cut my bangs just a bit shorter than usual. How do I look? Are they cute?
lia_stage: Y-yeah... Cuter than ever.
erica_stage: You really think so? How cute are they? Tell me how cute I am! Come on, tell me!
lia_stage: W-well...
cielo_stage: Lia, if I don't have enough gloves... I might end up actually touching a man's hand.
erica_stage: So how much cuter do I look with these shorter bangs?
Erica ＆ Cielo: Hey, Lia!
lia_stage: Enough! What difference does a pair of gloves or a little trim make?
lia_stage: Please, just let me concentrate!
ナレーション: Lia recalled the past week and let out a deep sigh.
lia: Whew. This week took so much out of me...
lia: I'm always looking after everyone else... Who's going to look after me?
？？？: You'll always have me, dearest Lia!
lia: Konjiro!
ナレーション: Lia grabbed her beloved stuffed toy fox, and made it talk while moving its arms and legs...
lia: Hey... I'm doing a good job, aren't I?
Konjiro: Of course you are! I know how hard you work. I know better than anyone!
lia: Hehe... I'm glad you think so.
Konjiro: You must be tired. There, there... I'm always here for you.
lia: Konjiro...
Konjiro: I'll cast the usual spell to cheer you up, okay? Keep fighting the good fight, Lia. 
Konjiro: Kon, kon, kooon!
lia: Yeah, I feel better already! 
lia: Thanks, Konjiro!
？？？: Wh-whoa... What should we do?
erica: We definitely weren't supposed to see that...
erica: This is bad, Cielo. She's talking to a stuffed animal like it's a person!
cielo: She's just tired, I'm sure. It's because we're always asking for her help with everything.
lia: Hehe! Konjiro! ♪ My dear friend Konjiro! ♪
Konjiro: Lia! ♪ My dear friend Lia! ♪
erica: Lia's going to lose her mind at this rate! We've got to do something!
cielo: Yeah, we have to do a better job of being there for her!
erica: You're right! We need to look after her!
Erica ＆ Cielo: Okay, let's do this!
ナレーション: And so, Lia's conversation with her stuffed toy fox became an unexpected source of inspiration for her companions...
