aqua: Happy anniversary! Let's toast with some bubbly!
wiz: U-Um, Aqua...I'm terribly sorry, but you do know our anniversary is in two days, right?
aqua: Let's forget about the details and just celebrate for now! 
aqua: Oh, I could really go for some good shark steak again.
aqua: Or we could make some Halloween candy, or some Christmas cake, 
aqua: or some mochi from New Year's!
aqua: It's been a whole year, so let's just combine a year's worth of celebrations into one big party!
wiz: W-Wait a minute! There's no way we could eat all that...
aqua: Oh, are you disobeying me? You know what happens when you disobey me,
