Ninja Transformation
ナレーション: One day, two beautiful women wearing exotic clothing stood in Wiz's shop...
arue_ninja: So...this is what the dreaded "rulers of the night" wear?
wiz_ninja: I believe Kazuma called them kunoichi. Female ninja from his home country.
arue_ninja: They were masters of terror and assassination... 
arue_ninja: Their command of stealth was so complete that no records about them survive— Only rumors and the nightmares of their enemies!
arue_ninja: They're ideal role models for a member of the Crimson Demons!
wiz_ninja: What a strange prize for a street stall raffle...
arue_ninja: I'm willing to bet that either Kazuma or Aqua made these... 
arue_ninja: The more I look at them, the more scandalous they appear.
wiz_ninja: Arue, please don't stare at me like that! 
wiz_ninja: You're going to make me blush...
arue_ninja: According to the pamphlet, kunoichi were masters of the art of seduction. 
arue_ninja: They would lull a target into complacency before ambushing them or slipping them poison.
wiz_ninja: The art of seduction?!
wiz_ninja: ...That certainly explains the clothing.
arue_ninja: A kunoichi employed every weapon at her disposal! 
arue_ninja: Say, why don't we practice our seduction skills?
wiz_ninja: What?! I don't know how to do that sort of thing! 
wiz_ninja: I'm just a shopkeeper!
arue_ninja: Well, I'm not going to poison you! Besides, 
arue_ninja: consider it research for a new novel!
wiz_ninja: I-I don't write novels...
arue_ninja: "Hello there. Mind if you're joined by a girl all on her lonesome?"
wiz_ninja: What are you talking about, Arue? 
wiz_ninja: Oh, are you...?
arue_ninja: "Don't tell me you're frightened of little old me, now."
wiz_ninja: A-Arue! I thought we were supposed be acting! 
wiz_ninja: Your breath tickles! Do you have to stand so close?!
arue_ninja: "Hehehe, don't worry. I can take you to heaven."
wiz_ninja: O-O-Oh, 
wiz_ninja: myyyyyyyyy!
arue_ninja: And...slice! You're dead.
wiz_ninja: H-Huh? A toy knife?
arue_ninja: If it were real, you wouldn't stand a chance. 
arue_ninja: Phew. The kunoichi were terrifying.
wiz_ninja: I see... So they struck when their victims were most vulnerable...
arue_ninja: Okay, Wiz. Now that you've seen how it's done, 
arue_ninja: why don't you give it a try?
wiz_ninja: What?! Me? But I...
arue_ninja: Come on! 
arue_ninja: What're you waiting for?!
wiz_ninja: You sound like Kazuma when he's thinking something untoward!
wiz_ninja: I-I don't know how to s-seduce someone!
arue_ninja: Heh. I didn't expect her to flee from embarrassment. 
arue_ninja: I wonder if she realizes she's still wearing that outfit...
arue_ninja: I bet a shy woman could make a great kunoichi too. 
arue_ninja: You know, that could be a good protagonist for my next novel.
ナレーション: Soon after, a new book about a kind-hearted shop clerk who was secretly a beguiling kunoichi became a bestseller...
