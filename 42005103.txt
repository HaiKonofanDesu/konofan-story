A Play for This Crimson Demon Author! - P3
ナレーション: As the performance approached, everyone was busy with their own preparations...
aqua_actor: Okay, I'm done! It took me half a day to make the Devil King's castle. What do you think?
kazuma_actor: Amazing! Seriously, how did you make this thing?
arue_actor: It really is impressive. Especially since you didn't have much to work with.
aqua_actor: Yeah, I think I did a pretty good job on such short notice. 
aqua_actor: After this, I was going to make a moat and drawbridge!
kazuma_actor: She really gets into her work once she gets started.\n
kazuma_actor: Wouldn't she be happier with a different job class?
arue_actor: I've been worried about this, since we're all amateurs and short-handed... 
arue_actor: But I think everything will turn out fine.
kazuma_actor: Aqua did a great job with the set and props.\n
kazuma_actor: Now, for the all-important script...
arue_actor: The script is complete! And it rivals Aqua's set in quality. 
arue_actor: Here, take a look!
arue_actor: So, did you two take a look at the script yet?\n
arue_actor: Let's give it a quick run-through.
aqua_actor: "Oh, brave hero! The princess has been captured!"
aqua_actor: Hey, this is supposed to be a serious scene, right? Should I really be talking with such a funny accent?
arue_actor: It's fine. A little excess is just what the situation needs.\n
arue_actor: It wouldn't make sense for a jester to be all serious.
arue_actor: "Oh? What's this now?! 
arue_actor: We must set off, and rescue the princess. 
arue_actor: Let us journey forth, brave Lord Kazuma!"
kazuma_actor: "Yes, we shall leave at once. I knew this day would come. 
kazuma_actor: The hero's blood in my veins yearns to slay the Devil King!"
kazuma_actor: Hero... Oh, that sounds so nice. Noble and loved by all, eventually marries a beautiful princess...
kazuma_actor: This is it! This is the life I want in this world!
aqua_actor: Hey, Kazuma. What's your next line? Also, you realize this 
aqua_actor: play is a work of fiction, right?
kazuma_actor: Why do you always have to rain on everyone's parade?!
kazuma_actor: Anyway, there are too many lines and not enough actors. I'm not sure I can remember them all.
arue_actor: It's not a particularly long play. There's still plenty of time, so you should be fine.
aqua_actor: She's right. Besides, as a goddess, I have a perfect memory!
kazuma_actor: Fine, whatever. Anyway, about the next scene...\n
kazuma_actor: It features both the Devil King and the princess. How should we do this?
aqua_actor: I made the costume just like you asked. What do you think?
kazuma_actor: Whoa, that's really good. It looks exactly like Verdia,\n
kazuma_actor: the Devil King's general!
aqua_actor: I know it's just a play, but I can't believe I'm looking to the Devil King of all people for inspiration.
aqua_actor: I really didn't want to do this, you know? But I refuse to give anything less than my absolute best!
kazuma_actor: It's annoying how she only has integrity when it suits her...
aqua_actor: You can climb inside to move it. Naturally, it's made from milk cartons. 
aqua_actor: Easy on both the environment and your wallet!
kazuma_actor: Wearing it over our own costumes means that one person 
kazuma_actor: can play the role whenever they're not already on stage.
kazuma_actor: We just need to figure out what to do about the princess...
arue_actor: Ah, I think I have a solution. In fact, she should be arriving soon...
ynyn_actor: Oh, my! What a coincidence!
arue_actor: See? Right on cue.
ynyn_actor: What lovely weather we're having today... 
ynyn_actor: It's the perfect day for a play!
aqua_actor: Why are you dressed like that, Yunyun?
ynyn_actor: Huh? This thing? Oh, I just thought it'd be nice 
ynyn_actor: to dress up like a princess for a change!
ynyn_actor: You need a princess, right? And I DO happen to be dressed as one! 
ynyn_actor: What a coincidence!
kazuma_actor: It's pretty obvious that she wants the part.
arue_actor: You have perfect timing, Yunyun. If you're free, would you like to play the part for us?
ynyn_actor: Ah, but could I handle such an important role...
arue_actor: Well, if you're too nervous, you could always play a tree.
ynyn_actor: A tree?! That's not even a character!
arue_actor: You don't want to play an inanimate object either? Oh well. 
arue_actor: In that case, I guess there's n—
ynyn_actor: Let me be the princess! I want to be on stage with all of you!
arue_actor: Okay. Here's the script.
ynyn_actor: Huh? A-are you sure?
arue_actor: Yes, I was just teasing you. Ahh, it's been too long.
ynyn_actor: Arue, 
ynyn_actor: you're so mean!
aqua_actor: She even had a script for Yunyun. Arue has a talent for taking care of people.
kazuma_actor: Indeed. Well, we need to learn our lines.\n
kazuma_actor: I don't want to mess up in front of these lovely set designs.
ナレーション: Yunyun joined the cast as the group rehearsed, with just under a week remaining until opening night...
