OVERLORD Collaboration P2 
megumin_O: This raging-flames red is cool, but I also really like the dark night aura of the jet black... 
megumin_O: Shalltear, which eyepatch goes better with this outfit? 
shalltear: *Sigh* I don't understand your sense of style. 
shalltear: Do you truly need to add more to an outfit made by a Duke of Hell?
megumin_O: All the more reason! 
megumin_O: I can't let all this coolness just go to waste! 
shalltear: Cool? I think you mean charming and adorable. 
shalltear: More importantly, are those robes for sale?
megumin_O: Yes! They're for adventurers who use magic. 
megumin_O: Shalltear, are you interested in learning magic? 
megumin_O: You've got to start with the outfit then. I'll loan you a hat, staff, and most importantly, an eyepatch! 
shalltear: It's not for me! I wanted it for Lord Ainz. 
shalltear: His current robe has gotten a bit dirty since coming here. 
megumin_O: Oh, I see! 
megumin_O: In that case, I've got just the thing. 
megumin_O: Normal-sized robes won't work for someone as tall as Ainz. 
shalltear: Th-That's true... 
megumin_O: Not to mention his appearance! 
megumin_O: As evil incarnate and master of the abyss, 
megumin_O: he'll want something to accent that.
megumin_O: Here! This robe is said to be made from the hide of a dark dragon! 
megumin_O: It's the perfect size too. He'll look so cool! 
shalltear: Oh, you're absolutely right! This will truly frame Lord Ainz's impressiveness. 
shalltear: Thank you, Megumin. Perhaps your sense of style isn't so bad, after all.
megumin_O: Hehe, 
megumin_O: you've seen the light! 
megumin_O: But you should know I can do better than that. 
megumin_O: Here, take this jet-black eyepatch too!
shalltear: ...Huh? 
megumin_O: Let's see, what else... 
megumin_O: Bandages! Imagine if he wraps it around his arms... Coolness to the max! And then how about—
shalltear: Please stop! 
shalltear: I retract it all! 
shalltear: I don't understand your sense of style at all! 
ナレーション: Shalltear suddenly felt a bit less confident about wearing an outfit that Megumin had called cool.
