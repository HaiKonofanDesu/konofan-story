Treasure Hunting on This Summer Vacation! - P6
Toothed Turtle: Gwoooaaarrrngh!
kazuma_swimwear: Yaaargh! 
kazuma_swimwear: I'm about to be 
kazuma_swimwear: turtle fodder!
darkness_swimwear: Release that man, foul reptile! Take me instead!
aqua_swimwear: Yeah, he's just a lowbie adventurer! Eating him would only give you indigestion!
kazuma_swimwear: What was that, Aqua? I demand you take that ba— 
kazuma_swimwear: Ow, 
kazuma_swimwear: ow, ow! 
kazuma_swimwear: He's eating me! Down the hatch I goooooo!
komekko_swimwear: Things aren't looking so good, Sis.
megumin_swimwear: And I can't use an Explosion, not while Kazuma's so close to the target.
arue_swimwear: Cursed Lightning!
iris_swimwear: Extellion!
Toothed Turtle: Grnnngh?
iris_swimwear: Kazuma, now! Get free!
kazuma_swimwear: Don't have to tell me twice! Alley-oop!
kazuma_swimwear: 　
aqua_swimwear: Kazuma's clear!
megumin_swimwear: Roger that! Let's turn up the heat a notch and a half! 
megumin_swimwear: EXPLOSION!!!
komekko_swimwear: Way to go, Sis!
Toothed Turtle: Bloooaaarghhh...
clair: Even after such a devastating blow, it still lives. The behemoth's hardiness is on par with its rarity and fame.
aqua_swimwear: Hey, with the turtle confused, I bet we could hop back on 
aqua_swimwear: and make off with its golden tooth. What do you say?
kazuma_swimwear: Wow, good thinking!
iris_swimwear: Wait, please!
kazuma_swimwear: Iris?
iris_swimwear: I don't mean to be troublesome... 
iris_swimwear: But wrenching the creature's tooth out seems a little...cruel.
clair: Oh, Princess, your kindness knows no bounds!
darkness_swimwear: She has a point. It's not as if the monster has caused harm to the people.
kazuma_swimwear: But, are you sure? I mean, we came all this way.
iris_swimwear: Positive. Besides, it's as Arue said before...
iris_swimwear: The time we spent together—that is the true treasure. 
iris_swimwear: No amount of gold can compare to this splendid summer vacation.
clair: Princess, you display maturity beyond your years!
kazuma_swimwear: Then I guess this is where we and the turtle part ways.
aqua_swimwear: I'll cast Heal on it, so it can return to the open sea.
kazuma_swimwear: Order up! I present to you my special seafood bowl!
aqua_swimwear: Looks delectable!
komekko_swimwear: *Nom nom* It IS delectable. 
komekko_swimwear: Seconds, please.
kazuma_swimwear: Whoa, did you even 
kazuma_swimwear: breathe?!
megumin_swimwear: A meal on the beach truly holds a different flavor. 
iris_swimwear: *Sigh*
darkness_swimwear: Is something troubling you, Princess? Why the sigh?
clair: Does the crude fare prepared by this boorish man not please you?
kazuma_swimwear: I'm standing right here, you know.
iris_swimwear: No, that's not it at all. Brother's cooking is delightful. 
iris_swimwear: It's 
iris_swimwear: just...
iris_swimwear: Fun times always seem to come to an end much too soon. If only this vacation never had to end.
kazuma_swimwear: It doesn't need to. Whenever you have time, 
kazuma_swimwear: let's hang out again.
iris_swimwear: Really? 
iris_swimwear: Claire, when's my next vacation?
clair: Not so soon, unfortunately. After all, you are the guiding light of our kingdom.
iris_swimwear: Yes, of course...
clair: H-However! 
clair: If these trips delight you so, none charged with your care, myself included, would object to another.
clair: It may not be right away, but I shall do my utmost to arrange 
clair: another vacation for you.
iris_swimwear: Wonderful! Thank you, Claire.
aqua_swimwear: Well, summer vacation's not over yet! 
aqua_swimwear: Let's make the most of it! Iris, wanna race against 
aqua_swimwear: the goddess of water?
iris_swimwear: Most certainly! 
iris_swimwear: ...But what do you mean by "goddess of water"?
clair: *Sigh* This will be my final chance to behold 
clair: the Princess in her swimsuit. I'd best savor the sight.
darkness_swimwear: I hope there's room in this race for one more?
arue_swimwear: Make that two more. 
arue_swimwear: Why come to the beach if you don't swim?
komekko_swimwear: I wanna race too, Sis!
megumin_swimwear: I commend your challenger's spirit, 
megumin_swimwear: which is why I too will join the fray! Everyone, let us battle!
kazuma_swimwear: Don't you guys ever run out of energy?
kazuma_swimwear: I have to say though... Iris may be right. Times like these are the real treasure.
aqua_swimwear: Kazuma, hurry or we'll start without you! 
aqua_swimwear: Last place has to carry everyone's stuff on the way back!
kazuma_swimwear: Wha—?! You gotta be kidding! 
kazuma_swimwear: Don't you dare start yet!
ナレーション: With the treasure hunt done, the party made the most of Iris's remaining time indulging in all sorts of summer fun.
