God's Blessing on Iris's Birthday! (2022)
iris_battle: B-Brother?!
kazuma: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! 
kazuma: For the love of god! 
kazuma: Someone, help meeeeeeeee!
Smoke Lizard Herd: Grrraaaaaargh!
aqua: Run faster, Kazuma! You're about to be torn into lizard fodder.
kazuma: You dare bark advice at me from the sidelines? You drew the herd our way with your magic in the first place!
darkness: Kazuma, you lucky dog. I wish I could be pursued by a herd of snarling— 
darkness: Ahem! I mean, what a terrible predicament!
megumin: Stop making light of the situation. 
megumin: If Kazuma gets trampled to death, Iris's birthday will be ruined!
kazuma: Noooooo! Getting trampled is not cool at all! 
kazuma: Iris, a little help here?!
iris_battle: Right! Duck, please! 
iris_battle: Extellion!
Smoke Lizard Herd: Fwaaaaaarrr...
kazuma: *Pant pant* Thank the goddess... 
kazuma: And thank you, Iris.
iris_battle: Please, I require no thanks. I'm the one who invited you on this perilous quest, after all.
aqua: Come to think of it, 
aqua: questing isn't a very conventional way to celebrate one's birthday.
darkness: Indeed. Wasn't your household at the castle worried?
iris_battle: They certainly were. 
iris_battle: But, I managed to convince Claire in the end—as my birthday present.
megumin: Heh...I suppose what's just a normal day to us is anything but that to you. 
megumin: Having fun, I hope?
iris_battle: Yes, lots! Venturing out of town, seeking danger in the field... 
iris_battle: I've never had a birthday quite like this before!
darkness: Glad to hear it. And the best part is, Princess...the day is far from over.
iris_battle: It is?
kazuma: Adventurers generally feast at the guild tavern after a quest. 
kazuma: Given what day it is, we'll feast even harder!
kazuma: But before all that, we'd like to wish you...
kazuma: a very happy birthday, Iris!
aqua: Happy birthday!
Megumin, Darkness: Happy birthday!
iris_battle: Everyone... 
iris_battle: Thank you so much!
