cielo: Um...
kazuma: Hey, Cielo. It's odd to see you all alone. 
kazuma: Where are Lia and Erika?
cielo: Actually, I wanted to talk to you about them.
aqua: Ah, did you have a fight?
cielo: I'm not sure, exactly.
cielo: They've been avoiding me for a few days, and I get the feeling they're hiding something.
darkness: Those two? Are you sure you aren't imagining things?
megumin: I mean, if you're worried about it, why not ask them?
cielo: B-But...it might be something they don't want me to know. 
cielo: I can't build up the courage to talk to them.
kazuma: I get it. You're looking for some encouragement. You should've come sooner! 
kazuma: We're friends, after all.
kazuma: Whatever happens, we're here for you. C'mon, let's go.
cielo: O-Okay...

cielo: Aah! You're right, it is my birthday! I was so focused on
