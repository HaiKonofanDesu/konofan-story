lia: Heh... Hehehe.
Fan A: Hm, something's different.
lia: ...Yay!
Fan B: Try to act a little more natural!
lia: Hahahahaha...
Fan C: Her expressions and poses are all too awkward.
kazuma: Hey, this is terrible. You need to try harder.
ナレーション: Lia was participating in her first individual photo shoot. Surrounded by fans and their cameras, she was quite nervous.
lia: You say that, but I'm not sure I can get used to this... What should I be doing?
Fan A: Hm, you need to be a bit cuter!
lia: C-cuter... What do you mean? What does any of this mean? 
lia: Cuter? So like, twirl and stuff?
Fan B: You need to be more sexy, dynamic, and wild! Like how a princess subdues the lizard runners with her wiles!
lia: Um, I've never seen a princess close up before...
aqua: So basically, she needs to be sexy, wild, and cute... Is that what they're saying? 
aqua: What does that even mean?
megumin: I guess it can't be helped... I'll have to give an example.\n
megumin: We Crimson Demons are experts at posing!
darkness: Hey, this is Lia's photo shoot. We're here to help if there's any trouble, but we shouldn't steal her thund—
megumin: Okay, everyone. Get your cameras ready... 
megumin: It is I, Megumin! 
megumin: Sexy, wild, and so incredibly cute!
Fan A: Um, excuse me. Could you please keep it down?
Fan B: I want pictures of Lia. I'm not interested in kids.
megumin: What? You dare to call me a child?! 
megumin: Ugh...
kazuma: Okay, okay, calm down. Don't go causing trouble here.
Fan A: I was hoping to get some really good shots here...
Fan B: Erika is so good at posing, too... I'm wondering if I should really be supporting Lia...
lia: I'm sorry. I really am trying my best.
kazuma: I thought Axel Hearts were still on the rise, but Lia's photo shoots have been pretty rough...
？？？: Grrraaawwwrrr...
darkness: What was that?
aqua: Sounds like a fan got way too excited.
Trolls: Rrraaawwwrrr!
megumin: No, monsters are coming!
kazuma: It's a pack of trolls... Is Daniel sending his lackeys after us again?
Fan A: Eek! What in the world are trolls doing here?!
Fan B: H-heeeeeelp!
lia: Get back, everyone! Hraaah!
aqua: Lia, wait! It's dangerous to go alone!
lia: Daniel is after us dancers. I can't let others suffer because of me. 
lia: I must protect my fans!
megumin: That's the spirit! I'll help too!
darkness: Let's go! Follow Lia!
