Ninja Transformation
ナレーション: With Amy called away on a sudden errand, Mitsurugi promised to keep an eye on Mia, who was running around town in a ninja costume she had gotten from Kazuma.
miia_ninja: Yaaaaaay!!!
mitsurugi_ninja: Mia, I'm glad you're having fun, but if you don't pay more attention to where you're going 
mitsurugi_ninja: you'll hurt yourself.
miia_ninja: It's fine! 
miia_ninja: Nin nin!
mitsurugi_ninja: ...Nin nin? 
mitsurugi_ninja: What's that supposed to mean?
miia_ninja: It's somethin' Kazuma taught me! He said it's what all 
miia_ninja: the strongest ninjas say! 
miia_ninja: Nin nin! ♪
mitsurugi_ninja: Kazuma Satou is filling her head with all sorts of nonsense again...
miia_ninja: Once I'm a real ninja, I'll be able to fly and breathe fire! 
miia_ninja: And I'll get good grades and be really popular with boys, too!
mitsurugi_ninja: Popular with boys?! 
mitsurugi_ninja: What is that evil man teaching this poor, innocent girl?!
miia_ninja: Do you know about ninjas too, Mitsurugi?
mitsurugi_ninja: Of course I do. Ninjas come from Japan, after all. 
mitsurugi_ninja: Want me to teach you what a real ninja's like?
miia_ninja: No thanks!
mitsurugi_ninja: Wh-What?!
miia_ninja: I'm already a ninja! 
miia_ninja: I'm an expert on the subject as it is!
mitsurugi_ninja: Hey! Where are you going?!
mitsurugi_ninja: ...She sure is a handful. But I promised Amy 
mitsurugi_ninja: I'd keep an eye on her.
mitsurugi_ninja: Mia, it's dangerous to leave town by yourself. We should 
mitsurugi_ninja: play ninja inside the walls.
miia_ninja: I guess you're right. But before we go back, I want to do 
miia_ninja: one more ninja art!
mitsurugi_ninja: Ninja art? Oh, gotcha. 
mitsurugi_ninja: You think you're ready?
miia_ninja: Hmph. You've been doubtin' me all day, haven't ya? 
miia_ninja: Fine! Watch this and be amazed!
miia_ninja: Ninja Art! Tremendous Thunderclap!
mitsurugi_ninja: Wh-What?!
mitsurugi_ninja: That was amazing, Mia! How did you make such a loud sound?! I can feel the vibrations in my bones!
miia_ninja: Ha! Surprised? This is nothin' 
miia_ninja: for a ninja like me! 
miia_ninja: ...Using ninja arts sure makes me tired, though.
mitsurugi_ninja: Haha, how long does it last? Wait—
mitsurugi_ninja: Is...that sound...?
miia_ninja: I'm so hungry that my thunderclap keeps rolling...
mitsurugi_ninja: Is that really your stomach?! 
mitsurugi_ninja: That's impressive!
miia_ninja: Ninja arts make me super hungry...
mitsurugi_ninja: Well, you've been running around all day. 
mitsurugi_ninja: How 'bout we head back and get something to eat?
miia_ninja: Really?! Hurray! Race ya back home! 
miia_ninja: C'mon, let's go!
mitsurugi_ninja: Hahaha! I thought you were worn out! Just be careful not to trip and hurt yourself.
miia_ninja: Ha! If I do, I'll bounce back as soon as I get some food! 
miia_ninja: Nin, nin! Nin nin nin!
ナレーション: The pair returned to the guild, where Mia demolished Mitsurugi's wallet by demonstrating her "bottomless stomach" ninja art.
