aqua: *Munch* 
aqua: Hey, Kazuma. Can I ask you something? 
kazuma: If it's my food you want, don't bother. 
kazuma: I'm just as hungry as you are, you know.
aqua: How did you know? I didn't even say anything.
megumin: That's not entirely true. You may not have said it in words, but your growling stomach is a dead giveaway.
darkness: Here, Aqua. You can have mine. I hope it's enough.
aqua: Thanks, Darkness! You're nothing like a certain cold-hearted 
aqua: cretin I know.
kazuma: Not true at all. I'll have you know I'm Kazuma, the man who 
kazuma: comes through in a pinch. I have quite the following now.
megumin: If you say so...
kazuma: It sounds like you don't believe me. 
kazuma: Even I've got a fan or two hiding in—
ynyn: Ex-Excuse me!
kazuma: You see?! Here's one of my— 
kazuma: Oh, it's just Yunyun.
ynyn: Huh? D-Did I do something wrong?
aqua: Ignore him. 
aqua: Anyway, what are you in such a hurry for?
ynyn: Oh, that's right! 
ynyn: Megumin, today's the day we duel!
ynyn: You've been avoiding my challenges for far too long, and it 
ynyn: looks like you have no quests right now. What do you say?
megumin: I'm in the middle of eating, after which I have the incredibly important task of taking a stroll.
ynyn: You totally have time! 
ynyn: You can go for a walk whenever!
megumin: Hey! Stop shaking me already!
ynyn: Come on! Please, have a duel with me!
megumin: What's wrong with you? 
megumin: You really think begging like that will make me want to battle?
ynyn: Huh?
megumin: Shoving yourself in someone's face like that is only going to chase them away. You should work on your manners.
ynyn: I see... Yeah, you're right. I never thought about that before. 
ynyn: But...how am I supposed to do that?
megumin: Instead of making demands, why don't you try inspiring me to duel you?
megumin: See if you can defeat that wyvern spotted near the Crimson Demon Village. 
megumin: I only wish to prove myself against worthy foes!
kazuma: Here we go again...
ynyn: G-Got it! 
ynyn: Just you wait! I'll defeat that evil wyvern!
darkness: H-Hey, Yunyun!
aqua: There she goes. Do you think she's actually planning to take on a wyvern all by herself?
megumin: Urgh...
kazuma: Great job running your mouth again. Are you really going to let Yunyun go alone?
megumin: I guess we have no other choice. Let's go after her, just in case she needs help.
aqua: Hehe... You can't admit you're worried for her, can you? 
aqua: Let's finish this food, then catch up to her! 
aqua: *Munch* 
aqua: *Chomp*
kazuma: Hey! Stop stealing my food when I'm not looking!
