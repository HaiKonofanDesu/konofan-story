God's Blessing on Yunyun's Birthday! (2022)
ynyn: "Wait just a minute. What's this all about?"
ynyn: "What are you all doing here? Is this a party?"
ynyn: "A birthday party? For me?! No way! 
ynyn: I don't believe it!"
ynyn: "This is such a surprise! Nobody has ever\n
ynyn: done something like this for me! I'm so happy!"
ynyn: Did that sound a little forced? Oh, they'll be so happy when they see how "surprised" I am!
ynyn: I'd better rehearse the part where I realize it's a surprise party one more time.
ynyn: "Huh? What's this all about?"
darkness: Why is Yunyun talking to herself in the alley?
megumin: She was invited out on her birthday, so she probably thinks there's a surprise party for her.
kazuma: Oh, it's Yunyun's birthday?
aqua: We were here for a teleport to the Crimson Demon Village. This is getting awkward...
ynyn: "I can't believe it. Everyone's here! Thank you so much! This is the best birthday ever!"
aqua: "Everyone"? But it's just us...
ynyn: "Wow! You got that huge cake just for me? Amazing! This really is the best birthday party ever!"
darkness: She's extremely eager. What's the plan, Kazuma?
kazuma: She's so full of hope. It'd be a shame to let her down.\n
kazuma: Let's get some people together and throw a party for her.
megumin: I'll take care of the cake, I guess...\n
megumin: B-but I'm not looking forward to it!
aqua: You're really into this, Megumin. I'm impressed that you remembered her birthday.
megumin: It's just a coincidence... 
megumin: Hey, what's with that expression? It just popped into my head. That's all!
darkness: If you say so.
kazuma: Shall we hit the road? We don't wanna be late to the party, after all.
ynyn: "I'm just so thrilled! Thank you so much, everyone!"
ynyn: Great, that was perfect!
ynyn: I hope Megumin and the others get here soon.
