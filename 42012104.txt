A Party on This Holy Night! - P4
ナレーション: A mere day removed from the Christmas party, Kazuma had realized the party was treeless—and now faced his latest trial...
miia_christmas: Think of an Elder Treant as the head honcho. He keeps the other treefolk in line.
darkness_christmas: The right to lead the grove is reserved for one and one alone—the flashiest.
darkness_christmas: That is why powerful Treant will decorate themselves with anything that takes their fancy, living or otherwise, to stay on top.
darkness_christmas: They cannot resist jewels or other trinkets, and will raid entire towns in search of rare baubles.
megumin: It's said that a Treant grove comparing their trappings is not unlike a fashion show, at least from afar.
kazuma: Yeah, a fashion show...where humans are the fashion. 
kazuma: Talk about creepy.
wiz_christmas: A whole city can be run to the ground in one single fashion-fueled frenzy.
aqua: Want to know what ultimately happens to the people strung up by the Treants?
kazuma: No? Not really? 
iris_christmas: A chilling story indeed.
kazuma: Geez, these monsters are no joke.
aqua: Honestly, they're nothing to lose sleep over. These are 
aqua: tales and nothing more. No one's seen the real thing.
kazuma: There you go with the foreshadowing again! I just want a regular tree, not one of those holiday horrors!
Child: Merry Christmas! 
darkness_christmas: Christmas is just a different beast. Everyone's in the holiday spirit.
wiz_christmas: Excuse me, I'm here to pick up the bird I ordered. 
Staff: Aye, miss! Merry Christmas! Your bird's ready and waiting right here, nice and hot!
miia_christmas: Wow, it's bigger than a barn! And roasted to 
miia_christmas: golden perfection! 
miia_christmas: *Slurp*
iris_christmas: I've never seen chicken prepared this way! 
iris_christmas: It smells heavenly!
wiz_christmas: The perfect choice for tonight's entrée. We're all going to have a ball.
miia_christmas: Look! There's even more tasty treats! Can we 
miia_christmas: get some of them too?!
darkness_christmas: They're making more food back home, including cake. 
darkness_christmas: Get too much and you'll have nowhere to put it.
miia_christmas: Haha! That's a problem I've never had! Whaddaya say, Iris?
iris_christmas: Yes, that sounds lovely. If there was ever a day to indulge, 
iris_christmas: this is most definitely it!
iris_christmas: So many exotic decorations for sale— They're like nothing I've ever seen... 
iris_christmas: Why, I feel like I'm dreaming!
miia_christmas: Yep, you said it! I've never been to a winter festival like this!
wiz_christmas: Oh? That's surprising.
miia_christmas: This time o' the year, we've got snow up to our rooftops. 
miia_christmas: Some days, we can't even leave the house.
miia_christmas: A lotta beastmen just sleep the season away, makin' winter 
miia_christmas: one giant snore. But not today! Today's all sorts o' fun!
darkness_christmas: I'm happy to hear it. By all means, go wild and make up for 
darkness_christmas: all those lost winter days.
miia_christmas: You said it! I'm gonna feast 'til I drop!
Street Vendor: Music to my ears, lil' lassie! How's about some Christmas Blood Fang kebab?
miia_christmas: Sounds yummy! Load me up, mister!
darkness_christmas: Now hold on. We've already got this gargantuan bird.
darkness_christmas: Let's hold off on more meat, shall we?
wiz_christmas: Sorry, but we've got quite enough food as it is. Some jolly Christmas brew, on the other hand, would be lovely.
Street Vendor: You got it! Merry Christmas!
wiz_christmas: There. The perfect dinnertime companion for a very particular pair of lushes, Kazuma and Aqua.
iris_christmas: Yes, those two love their bubbly.
miia_christmas: Okay, team! Back to base! I bet they're almost done whippin' up that cake! 
miia_christmas: Yee-haw!
darkness_christmas: Mia, don't run! You're bound to bump into some—
Local A: Hey, what the heck?!
miia_christmas: Urmph! 
miia_christmas: ...Owie. 
miia_christmas: Sorry, mister!
Local A: Oh, don't worry about it, younglin'! The holidays're a time to be boisterous! Merry Christmas!
Local B: You okay there? Chase the pain away with a jolly Christmas cheer! Merry Christmas!
iris_christmas: Listen! The whole town's saying "Merry Christmas." 
iris_christmas: Aqua's Christmas campaign really paid off, wouldn't you say?
wiz_christmas: It did—the town's interpretation of the holiday doesn't quite match up with what Kazuma's described, but I think it captures the heart. 
wiz_christmas: Ahaha... 
ナレーション: With neighbor helping neighbor amidst Christmas greetings, the holiday spirit took root in Axel...sort of, anyway.
