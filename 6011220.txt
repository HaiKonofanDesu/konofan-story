God's Blessing on Dust's Birthday! (2022)
dust: Hey, Kazuma! Hey, everyone!
aqua: Oh, you're awfully chipper today.
kazuma: Did you come into some cash? If so, you owe me lunch.
dust: Sorry, but I should be the one getting a free lunch today. 
dust: After all, today marks the glorious day I was born!
darkness: Oh, congratulations.
megumin: So it's pretty much the same as any other day... I see Kazuma and Rin paying for your lunch every day.
dust: Hey, be nice. Besides, there are more important things to attend to... C'mon now!
kazuma: What's with that eager look on your face?
dust: Don't play dumb. Presents!
dust: I'll gladly take cash!
kazuma: Forget it!
dust: Don't be like that. We're pals, right?
aqua: True pals don't try to coerce presents out of each other.
darkness: Furthermore, money is such a tasteless birthday gift.
megumin: I agree. It's the thought behind the present that counts.
dust: So you're saying you don't think of me at all?!
kazuma: Fine, fine. My present to you shall be all the times I've had to pay for you thus far.
dust: I'm begging you!
kazuma: *Sigh* Whatever. I'll buy you one drink, then. 
kazuma: I guess you do help us out once in a blue moon.
dust: I knew I could count on my friends! Let's invite Rin, too! 
dust: The more the merrier, am I right?
kazuma: There he goes again...
darkness: Well, it is a special occasion.
dust: Happy birthday to me! I'm gonna drink all day long!
kazuma: I said I'd buy you one drink!
dust: I know, I know... But you never said what size!
ナレーション: And so, Kazuma and company started drinking at noon and continued deep into the night...
