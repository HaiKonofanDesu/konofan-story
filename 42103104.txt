A Duet with This Crimson Demon Girl! - P4
ナレーション: The night before the Axel Singing Contest, Megumin paid a visit to Kazuma's room...
kazuma_jersey: M-Megumin?!
megumin_pajama: Oh, good. You're still awake. I'm coming in.
kazuma_jersey: If you need something, make it quick. I'm exhausted from our rehearsal today.
megumin_pajama: It was our last rehearsal, so I think Erika and Cielo really wanted to make sure we gave it our all. 
megumin_pajama: Kazuma...
kazuma_jersey: Hm? What is it?
megumin_pajama: I just... 
megumin_pajama: I wanted to thank you for doing this with me. And for putting up with the tough practices every day.
megumin_pajama: I feel a little bad for forcing you into this.
kazuma_jersey: Nah, it's fine. The rehearsals were actually kind of fun. 
kazuma_jersey: And once the show is over, my reward is waiting for me.
megumin_pajama: Hehe, that sounds just like you.
kazuma_jersey: She's being awfully honest tonight.
kazuma_jersey: So you came just to thank me? I appreciate the thought, but you must be tired too. You should get some—
megumin_pajama: Not yet. Since you worked so hard during today's rehearsal, I wanted to give you your reward a little early...
ナレーション: Megumin gently sat down next to Kazuma, slowly turning to look up into his eyes.
kazuma_jersey: Oh... 
kazuma_jersey: Huh?! 
kazuma_jersey: Wh-Wh-What's gotten into you, Megumin?!
megumin_pajama: Hehe... Weren't you listening to me just now? I'm here to give you your reward.
kazuma_jersey: I-Is this it?! Is this where we're supposed to fall back into each other's arms?!
kazuma_jersey: No, wait... Calm down. If I judge the situation wrong, 
kazuma_jersey: I'll blow my chance of any sort of reward.
kazuma_jersey: I'll be branded the kind of adventurer who takes advantage of his party members and lose all credibility in Axel!
kazuma_jersey: Think, Kazuma Satou! What do I do?!
kazuma_jersey: Hmm...
megumin_pajama: Kazuma, aren't you going to say anything? This is pretty embarrassing for me, you know.
kazuma_jersey: S-Sorry. 
kazuma_jersey: Are you sure about this, though? 
kazuma_jersey: D-Don't go changing your mind on me now!
megumin_pajama: Of course. It's your reward...after all.
kazuma_jersey: O-Okay, here goes...
aqua: Kazuma! You awake?!
Kazuma, Megumin: Huh?
aqua: Bottles of my best bubbly are missing! Have you been filching from my stash again?!
kazuma_jersey: I should have seen this coming!
megumin_pajama: I guess we'll leave it there for tonight.
megumin_pajama: Let's pick this up where we left off once the Axel Singing Contest is over. For now, sleep well.
kazuma_jersey: Y-Yeah, okay...
kazuma_jersey: Insisting on partnering with me for the contest... Going out of her way to reward me...
kazuma_jersey: I thought this seemed a little strange... 
kazuma_jersey: B-But could Megumin actually have feelings for me?!
kazuma_kayoshow: The excitement of the crowd! A stage even grander than I'd imagined!
kazuma_kayoshow: I wonder why so many of the contestants are beefcakes... 
kazuma_kayoshow: Oh well, I'm ready to put on a show no one will forget!
megumin_kayoshow: That's the spirit, Kazuma! 
megumin_kayoshow: Now let's go out there and make history together!
lia_stage: Welcome to the Axel Singing Contest!
lia_stage: I am Lia of Axel Hearts, and I will be your host this evening! We hope you enjoy the show!
Axel Hearts Fan A: Liaaa! I came just to hear your beautiful voice!
Axel Hearts Fan B: You're not just the host, right?! You're performing too, aren't you?! Oh, I can't wait to see Axel Hearts!
megumin_kayoshow: So many people are cheering for Axel Hearts. I should have expected as much for the winners of the dance contest.
lia_stage: The winning team will receive 10,000 Eris per contestant, and one group will then be crowned as the best singers.
lia_stage: Our grand prize winners will receive a whopping one million Eris! 
lia_stage: Who will claim victory? Team Red or Team White?!
lia_stage: And which group will be our greatest singers?! 
lia_stage: Get ready for an exciting show, everyone!
kazuma_kayoshow: If we can claim the top spot, 
kazuma_kayoshow: I'll get a reward from Megumin AND boatload of cash? 
kazuma_kayoshow: Now I'm really getting fired up!
lia_stage: Now for what may prove to be the deciding factor: the selection of our teams!
lia_stage: Chomukororin, Team Red!
megumin_kayoshow: That's a relief! We're on the red team with Axel Hearts!
kazuma_kayoshow: Back up a second. Did you name our group Chomukororin?
megumin_kayoshow: I sure did! It's a name befitting the annals of history, wouldn't you agree?
kazuma_kayoshow: Not even a little! 
kazuma_kayoshow: But...I'll let her have her fun today. 
kazuma_kayoshow:  After all, I've got a reward waiting for me tonight!
dust: You two are on the red team, huh? 
dust: Guess that makes you our rivals, then!
kazuma_kayoshow: Dust?! You're competing too?!
lean: I tried to stop him... 
lean: He's convinced 
lean: he's going to get rich. 
lean: I figured joining him would be the best way to limit the damage.
dust: Team White is going to win for sure! Then the two of us will claim the grand prize!
kazuma_kayoshow: You sure about that? Megumin and I are about to put on the performance of a lifetime. You'd best be prepared. Hahaha!
lia_stage: And that brings us to our final group. Goddess & Lalatina! 
lia_stage: Team Red! They will be Team Red's first contestants!
kazuma_kayoshow: Goddess & Lalatina? 
kazuma_kayoshow: Wait, is that Aqua and Darkness?!
aqua: Watching your rehearsal yesterday was fun, so I signed Darkness and myself up at the last minute!
darkness: Wait, what? This is the first I've heard of this, Aqua!
aqua: Don't worry. Just do exactly what I tell you to and everything will be fine.
darkness: Y-You're going to order me around...? 
darkness: What exactly are you going to make me do?!
Male Audience Member: Lalatina! I've been a huge fan of yours since the qualifying rounds of the dance contest!
Female Audience Member: You mean we get to see Lady Aqua perform first?! This is going to be the greatest show ever!
aqua: Oh, you're too kind! Thanks for the support!
darkness: D-Don't call me Lalatina! 
kazuma_kayoshow: What will the two of you sing? You haven't practiced anything.
aqua: What are you talking about, Kazuma? Goddess & Lalatina has the perfect technique for wowing the crowd!
aqua: First up, I'll have Darkness stretch out her hands and... 
aqua: Nature's Beauty!
kazuma_kayoshow: You're not even singing?!
