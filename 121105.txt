mel_stage: La lalalala ♪
erica: We somehow finished 
erica: with only an hour left before the show.
lia: Yeah, even memorizing a new song is hard work. Mel sure is talented!
mel_stage: I've done as much as I can, but I'm still a little nervous.
cielo: The only solution for nervousness is more practice! 
cielo: Let's take it again from the top!
mel_stage: Sure thing! Let's do it!
lia: Hold on a sec. We should take a water break first. 
lia: It's important to stay hydrated.
lia: Mel, is it alright if I drink from your water bottle?
mel_stage: Sure— Wait, which one? 
mel_stage: No, stop! That's not water!
lia: Blergh! 
lia: *Cough 
lia: cough*
erica: Lia?! What's wrong?!
mel_stage: Ah! I'm so, so sorry! 
mel_stage: That's a special drink I make...I call it Devil's Sweat.
cielo: Are you all right, Lia?!
lia: Yeah, I'm— Huh? 
lia: My voice...
mel_stage: What are we going to do? I blended the spiciest peppers I could find...
erica: And now she's lost her voice?! But we have a show tonight!
lia: It's not...Mel's fault... 
lia: I should...have listed to her...
cielo: Hold still a moment... 
cielo: Heal!
lia: Thanks. That feels much better. 
lia: Ah... Ah...
lia: Ah...
lia: I still won't be able to sing though...
cielo: Th-That's terrible...
mel_stage: I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! This is all my fault!
erica: Don't apologize! It was an honest mistake. Just help us find some way to fix this! Is there anything you can do?
cielo: Recovery magic helped a little... Perhaps if we used an even stronger healing spell?
mel_stage: That's it! Aqua! I'm sure she can help us!
luna: Kazuma and company? As far as I know, 
luna: they haven't returned from their quest yet.
erica: Of all days to be late, why today?!
luna: They intended to return in time for your show, but they might have run into unexpected trouble.
mel_stage: N-No way! Without Aqua here, we can't fix Lia's voice.
Audience: Axel Hearts! Axel Hearts! Axel Hearts!
erica: Is that the audience?
cielo: It's nearly time for the show to start! What should we do?
lia: The show must go on. 
lia: Don't worry, I think my voice is 
lia: getting bet— *Cough cough*
erica: Don't strain yourself, Lia!
mel_stage: Just hold on until Aqua gets back! 
mel_stage: I'll 
mel_stage: buy us 
mel_stage: some time!
Audience: Axel Hearts! Axel Hearts! Axel Hearts!
iris_stealth: The crowd is so enthusiastic!
clair: They sure are. As expected, the home crowd is on another level entirely. I believe the show is about to begin.
Fan A: Hey, what gives?
Fan B: Start the show already!
Fan C: They've never started late before. Is something wrong?
rain: The fans seem agitated for some reason. You don't suppose there's been some trouble?
？？？: We sincerely apologize for the delay, everyone!
iris_stealth: Rain! Claire! It's starting!
Fan A: Who do you think's coming out first tonight?! Will it be Lia? Cielo? Maybe Erika?!
Fan B: No, look! That's...!
mel_stage: H-Hello. I'm Mel, the lightning spirit! 
mel_stage: I know I'm not who you were expecting, but I'll be tonight's opening act.
rain: Wait, what?!
clair: After all that running around, she goes up on stage 
clair: right in front of me?! I'll arrest her here and now—
iris_stealth: Hold on, Claire! ...She looks terribly upset about something. 
iris_stealth: I think you should let her be for just a while longer.
clair: I...
mel_stage: I know my pranks have caused a lot of trouble 
mel_stage: for many of you, but I just want to make friends and help people smile!
mel_stage: So... 
mel_stage: Tonight my song will be my way of 
mel_stage: apologizing and expressing my gratitude toward all of you!
lia: M-Mel...
cielo: She's singing in our place.
kazuma: What's Mel doing up on stage by herself?
erica: Wh-Where have you been?!
kazuma: And what are you three doing here?!
cielo: We'll explain later! Aqua, please cast some healing magic on Lia!
mel_stage: *Pant pant* 
mel_stage: Are you ready for the next song?!
iris_stealth: Mel certainly has a lovely singing voice.
rain: She does. And that outfit looks quite cute on her as well. Wouldn't you agree, Claire?
clair: Her clothing has no relation on whether she's dangerous to humans. Although... 
clair: I will admit she sings well.
rain: Hehehe. You truly are a stubborn one.
Audience: Oooooohhh!
iris_stealth: I find it hard to believe someone who makes so many people this happy could be a danger to others.
Daniel, Charlie: Stop right there!
iris_stealth: What are those two doing here?!
daniel: I won't be distracted by your charm! 
daniel: What happened to Axel Hearts?
charlie: That's right! Give us Axel Hearts! Nothing can replace the 
charlie: real thing! You're just a nuisance! Get off the stage!
mel_stage: A-A nuisance?! But I... I don't want to be 
mel_stage: like that anymore...
lia_stage: You're not a nuisance! 
lia_stage: Thanks for covering for us, Mel.
Fan A: Lia! We've been waiting for you!
erica_stage: You two are the ones who need to leave! 
erica_stage: How are you still alive, anyway?
cielo_stage: How dare you interrupt her performance! We won't let you get away with this!
Fan B: Cielo and Erika are angry too? Is this part of the show?
Fan C: Probably. Mel's here too. Maybe they're trying something new.
mel_stage: Lia, your voice!
aqua: She's good as new after one of my special healing spells!
megumin: And fear not! Now that we're here, no harm shall befall you!
daniel: You dare stand between me and my true love again?!
darkness: I've lost track of how many times we've had to deal with these two. They sure don't know when to quit.
kazuma: Yeah, but this time it's curtains for them!
iris_stealth: Brother, allow me to assist you!
