megumin_school: Putting on this uniform reminds me of my school days.
megumin_school: Practicing my poses with Funifura... Borrowing Dodonko's notes the night before a big test...
megumin_school: Going hunting with Arue... We had a lot of good times here, didn't we?
ynyn_school: Um, Megumin? Don't you have any fond memories of me?
megumin_school: Uhhh... Which class were you in again?
ynyn_school: Wh-What?! We were in the same class!
I even shared my lunch with you every day!
megumin_school: You didn't share anything—that was payment for all the times I beat you in our various contests.
ynyn_school: So you do remember! Well, what about those memories?\n
ynyn_school: Those count as good memories, right?!
ynyn_school: Oh yeah, that reminds reminds me—I made this special for today.
megumin_school: A homemade lunch? This sure brings me back.
ynyn_school: I made sure to pack it with all your favorite things.
megumin_school: I see... So you wish to wager this lunch over a friendly competition like we did in the old days, is that it?
ynyn_school: N-No, that's not it at all. I just wanted to make this for you.
megumin_school: For...me?
ynyn_school: Yeah. You always ended up taking my lunches, so we never actually had a chance to eat together while in school.
ynyn_school: That's why...I thought today we could eat togeth—
megumin_school: This looks great! *Munch munch munch*
ynyn_school: Aaahhh!
megumin_school: *Hiccup* Your lunches always were delicious, Yunyun.
ynyn_school: You finished it all in seconds...
megumin_school: What're you so sad for? You said you made it for me, didn't you?
ynyn_school: My dream was to eat lunch together with a good friend. This... This is no different than when we were in school.
ynyn_school: But I still haven't given up! I'll just have to make another lunch and try again tomorrow!
ナレーション: She visited Megumin's house the following day, but Komekko ate the lunch, ruining Yunyun's dream yet again...
