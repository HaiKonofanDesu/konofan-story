Amy - P3
Amy: *Sniff* It's no use... My life is ruined!
kazuma: Whoa, settle down. I can't understand you when you're crying.
darkness: Amy, what's the matter?! Did Kazuma do something?\n
darkness: Was it something so vile that it made you break down?!
kazuma: Wh-what?! I didn't do anything! She started crying as soon 
kazuma: as she saw me. It's...not me, right?
Amy: *Sob* I'm sorry. It's not you, Kazuma. It's my fault. It's all my fault!
darkness: Can you tell us about it?
Amy: Mia... 
Amy: Mia doesn't like me anymore!
kazuma: Huh? Mia would never get angry with you, Amy...
Amy: She would! She...was mad at me. I'll never forgive myself\n
Amy: if Mia doesn't like me!
darkness: Calm down, Amy. Tell us what happened, and we'll talk to Mia about it for you. If she really is angry, thenâ€”
Amy: It won't work! My life is over!
kazuma: *Sigh* This is getting us nowhere. Let's talk with Mia.
darkness: Good idea. They usually get along so well, so this is concerning.
kazuma: Hey, Mia. How are you?
miia: I'm fine, as always. What's up, Kazuma?\n
miia: I see Amy is with you, too...
Amy: *Sob sob*
miia: What's the matter, Amy? Are you okay?
darkness: Yeah, Amy is fine. Keep going, Kazuma.
kazuma: I just have to ask... Did you and Amy have a fight?
miia: Of course not. Amy and I always get along.\n
miia: We'd never get into a fight.
kazuma: She doesn't dislike you. She's not even mad.\n
kazuma: You must be mistaken, Amy.
Amy: You don't understand! Mia is holding back in front of everyone 
Amy: because she's such a good girl!
Amy: But she was upset at me! She was angry!
miia: Upset? Angry? At you?
darkness: Hmm... Hey, Amy. What made you think that Mia was upset?
Amy: *Sniff* We were talking around noon...about everything.
Amy: Like how the sky is especially blue today.\n
Amy: Or how the clouds are flying really high.
Amy: Then, when lunch was ready, Mia...
Amy: Okay, dig right in!
miia: Let's eat! 
miia: *Nom nom*
Amy: Hehe, I made all of your favorites today. You can slow down, there's plenty.
miia: Hmm... This is no good.
Amy: Wha?
Amy: Wait... I must have misheard you just now.\n
Amy: What did you say, Mia?
miia: This isn't good!
Amy: Wha?
Amy: *Sob* I can't do much of anything for you, so if you don't like my cooking, then it's all over.
darkness: I can understand your shock.
kazuma: Did you really say that after she cooked for you?
miia: No, I didn't say that your cooking was bad.
Amy: Huh? Then...why?
miia: I meant that it's no good if I eat such delicious meals every day,\n
miia: I won't be able to eat anything but your cooking!
miia: You're always helping me out. It must be tiring.
Amy: M-M-Mia...! You're such an angel!
Amy: You don't have to worry about me being tired. 
Amy: I'll make food for you for the rest of my life!
miia: Really?
Amy: Of course! When you tell me my food is good,\n
Amy: I feel my weariness melt away in an instant!
miia: Yaaay! 
miia: I love you, Amy!
Amy: I love you too, Mia!
kazuma: Um, Darkness? Did we help at all?
darkness: There's no problem, so let's be satisfied with that.
Amy: You can always count on me to take care of you!
