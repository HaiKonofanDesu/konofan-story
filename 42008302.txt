The Great Wyvern - P2
ナレーション: Though taken by surprise, the group eventually managed to put down the fanged fiend.
erica_stage: Waaaaaah! I was so scaaaaaared!
aqua: There, there. It's all over.
erica_stage: Hold meeeeee!
erica_stage: *Sob*
darkness: Erika's thoroughly spooked. We might as well call it a day and head home.
erica_stage: *Whimper* *Sob*
erica_stage: Waaaaaah...wah? In the name of all that's cute—wait! We still haven't taken a single picture!
erica_stage: As you can clearly see, I'm adorable even when crying!
erica_stage: This is the perfect chance for a photo shoot. Pleeease?
kazuma: Her business sense is sharp, but the urge to slap her is overwhelming.
erica_stage: *Sob* When the fans see poor lil' Erika crying
erica_stage: her heart out, they're sure to go bonkers!
kazuma: If it makes you happy...fine. Places, everyone!
darkness: Reflector, ready!
aqua: Water's locked and loaded!
megumin: Magic camera is primed!
erica_stage: Thanks, everyone! Our teamwork will propel my charm to
erica_stage: uncharted heights! Behold—crying has never been this cute!
kazuma: I'm beat... How many shots are we taking? We've used way too much film.
kazuma: I think we blew through our budget twenty poses ago.
darkness: Ah...my arms are burning from holding the reflector. They've never been this sore.
megumin: With the sun going down, we might as well call it
megumin: a wrap and head home.
erica_stage: Look! Have you ever seen such a breathtaking sunset?
erica_stage: You know what I'm thinking?
aqua: Please, no.
erica_stage: If by "no,"
erica_stage: you mean "yes,"
erica_stage: then yes!
erica_stage: Imagine... My perfect silhouette, draped in the gentle
erica_stage: glow of descending twilight! That's as cute as it gets!
erica_stage: C'mon, let's find a spot! I'm thinking a picturesque meadow, caught
erica_stage: in the last light of a dying sun, with first stars... Well?
kazuma: "Well"? Well forget it!
kazuma: We've taken enough photos to last us
kazuma: two freaking lifetimes! Tell her, Darkness!
darkness: I don't really mind being forced to stand for hours on end...
erica_stage: You're the greatest, Darkness!
megumin: So...hungry...
aqua: Me too. I could really use a cold glass of the good stuff right now.
erica_stage: Aw, don't be like that. Just a few more snaps, that's all!
erica_stage: You'll thank me when you see the results!
kazuma: Ugh. In a weird way, Erika's the toughest one here. She's indefatigable when the spotlight's on her.
erica_stage: Don't worry! My cuteness will re-energize those drooping
erica_stage: smiles! Now, who's the cutest in the world?
ナレーション: Of course, the photos sold like hotcakes, earning Erika a legion of new fans and encouraging her to pursue even greater heights of cuteness.
