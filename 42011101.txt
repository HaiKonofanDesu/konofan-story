pack: Huh? What are you doing working out here, Subaru? Today isn't your day to tend the garden, is it?
subaru: Ram is feeling sick after eating some bad food, so I’m helping out.
rem: My apologies, Subaru. I do hope my sister will be feeling better by tomorrow.
emilia: That's too bad. Since the weather is so nice, I wanted to invite you on a picnic, but you look rather busy.
subaru: Don't worry! I'll finish this up in no time! Just give me a few minutes to...
subaru: Huh? 
？？？: Ribbit...
emilia: It's so big! 
emilia: What is this thing?
pack: Something feels a little off about it.
subaru: No reason to be alarmed. It may be big, and that coloring is pretty strange, but it's still just a big frog.
？？？: Ribbit!!
subaru: Just how long is its tongue?!
emilia: I can't believe it wrapped us all up at once. 
emilia: Wait, is it...
Everyone: Waaaaaahhh!!
subaru: Ungh...
subaru: Huh? ...Where am I?
rem: Subaru, you're finally awake!
subaru: Right...
subaru: Wait! What is that smell?
emilia: It appears we were all swallowed whole. When we came to, 
emilia: we were here. Puck doesn't think we're in the Kingdom of Lugunica anymore.
pack: That toad's stomach was connected to another place. I think it's a kind of teleportation magic.
pack: That certainly explains the strange feeling I had.
？？？: Cabba cabba cabba cabba...
emilia: H-Hey, did you hear that just now?
Cabbage Swarm: Cabba cabba cabba cabba...
subaru: What the heck is that? A swarm of flying cabbages?!
pack: I'm sensing enormous magical energy building up in that—
？？？: Explosion!!
Cabbage Swarm: Cabba...
emilia: The whole swarm is gone...
megumin: That sure...felt good. Ahh...
aqua: All right, let's collect the ones that weren't completely destroyed! 
aqua: We're eating cabbage tonight!
kazuma: Hm? It looks like somebody is over there. 
kazuma: Wait! Nobody was hurt by Megumin's explosion magic, were they?
subaru: Were those things really cabbages? How the heck do vegetables fly, anyway? 
subaru: Something ain't right here...
kazuma: Wait, is that a tracksuit? Was he sent here like I was?
megumin: What are you talking about? Everyone knows vegetables can fly. It's as natural as harvesting mackerel from a field.
emilia: R-Really?! I've never heard such things...
pack: It appears common practices are a little different here. 
pack: And on that note, would you mind telling us exactly where we are?
aqua: This is Axel, a town for beginner adventurers.
rem: Axel? I have never heard of a town by that name.
subaru: That's just great! Where the heck are we? This is all that giant rainbow frog's fault for eating us!
kazuma: D-Did you say...a giant rainbow frog...?
aqua: Kazuma, Kazuma! You don't think...!
pack: Oh? You seem to have some idea of what we're talking about. 
pack: Would you mind sharing with us?
darkness: Before that, we should introduce ourselves. 
darkness: I'm Darkness. This is Kazuma and Aqua, and that's Megumin down there.
darkness: We're here on a quest to hunt this swarm of cabbages. What about you?
emilia: My name is Emilia. This here is Puck, my contracted spirit.
pack: Nice to meet you.
rem: I am Rem, a maid in the employ of Roswaal Mansion.
aqua: Roswaal? Never heard of it.
subaru: And I am Subaru Natsuki!
kazuma: Subaru Natsuki... That sounds extremely Japanese to me. 
kazuma: Now I'm sure of it! He must have been sent here too!
kazuma: Why don't you come back with us so we can discuss what's 
kazuma: going on? I'd like to speak to you in particular, Subaru.
subaru: Me? All right, I guess...
kazuma: Great. 
kazuma: We'll try to explain the giant frog, as well.
