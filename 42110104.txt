Home Again with These Pumpkins! P4
ナレーション: Kazuma and company made a pit stop in Samuidoh during their mission to catch smelt for tempura...
miia: I'm baaaaaack! 
megumin_winter: Kazuma, we need to go to the lake to catch smelt. Do we have this kind of time? 
kazuma_winter: It's fine. Tempura needs both fish and vegetables, and 
kazuma_winter: there's no better place for fresh veggies. 
aqua_winter: Wait until you try veggie tempura! It's delicious! 
Amy: How are the greenhouses doing? Anything delicious? 
Samuidoh Resident: Oh, the greenhouses are looking great. For this time of year, I'd recommend the eggplants.
aqua_winter: That sounds great! Eggplant dishes always go great with a nice glass of bubbly! 
kazuma_winter: Have you already forgotten why we're here? Evil, man-eating pumpkins maybe? 
miia: Here we are! This is where the smelt live.
megumin_winter: Wow, I never knew such a majestic lake was just around the corner. 
aqua_winter: It's frozen solid, too. 
aqua_winter: What a picture-perfect view! 
kazuma_winter: Let's get started then, shall we? 
kazuma_winter: Hyup! 
Amy: Kazuma, may I ask why you have a shovel? 
kazuma_winter: I'm digging a hole so we can drop a fishing line into the water. 
kazuma_winter: How else are we gonna catch some smelt? 
darkness_winter: Sorry, but I don't quite understand. 
miia: Does Kazuma think the smelt will be buried in the ice? 
kazuma_winter: Huh?! 
kazuma_winter: Where I'm from, you've got to cut a hole in the ice for your line. 
kazuma_winter: How do you guys fish? 
Amy: I see the problem. We must be thinking of different animals. 
Amy: Smelt are wild game that live in the mountains. 
kazuma_winter: Not this again! I should have known! 
kazuma_winter: I see. 
kazuma_winter: Mackerel are grown in fields, so I guess smelt living in the woods is...
kazuma_winter: the most ridiculous thing I've heard! 
miia: Smelt make nests in the treetops. All you gotta do is give the tree a good kick and they fall right out. 
miia: Hyah! 
Amy: Wow, that was amazing, Mia. You're so strong. 
kazuma_winter: I feel like we're hunting rhinoceros beetles. 
aqua_winter: Give it a good shake... 
aqua_winter: Oh, right there! 
aqua_winter: Someone catch it! 
Smelt: Skreeee! Skreeee!
darkness_winter: It's trying to hop away! Kazuma, get it! 
kazuma_winter: Snipe! 
Smelt: Skreee!
megumin_winter: Direct hit! Our first catch of the day! 
kazuma_winter: They're bigger than I was expecting. And they sound more like a bird than a fish. 
aqua_winter: All right, if we keep this up, we'll have more than— 
Amy: Eeeeeek! 
miia: What's wrong, Amy?! 
Mushroom: Matsu...taketakeeeeee!
megumin_winter: Kazuma, over there! Those are matsutake mushrooms!
kazuma_winter: Nice, those are a delicacy, perfect for making tempura. Let's catch some.
darkness_winter: Stop messing around, Kazuma! 
darkness_winter: Hurry up and get behind me!
kazuma_winter: What's with the sudden panic, Darkness? 
darkness_winter: Kazuma, get back! Matsutake are known as the emperors of autumn! 
darkness_winter: With their combat strength, a single blow can—
Mushroom: Matsu...taketaketaketakeeeeee!
kazuma_winter: Uh... 
megumin_winter: Kazumaaa! 
Amy: K-Kazuma! 
aqua_winter: Oh, no! His neck's twisted at a weird angle! 
kazuma_jersey: Hrn... 
eris: Welcome to the afterlife. 
eris: Um... How many times is this now? 
kazuma_jersey: I'm sorry. 
kazuma_jersey: In my defense, how was I supposed to know 
kazuma_jersey: matsutake mushrooms were stupidly strong? 
eris: In this world, they are known as the emperors of autumn. They also release spores that cause hallucinations.
kazuma_jersey: This is ridiculous. Pumpkins threatening towns, smelt flying around in the mountains...
kazuma_jersey: And after all that, I'm done in by a single punch from some stupid mushroom? 
kazuma_jersey: What's wrong with this world?! 
kazuma_jersey: I can't take it anymore! I'm not going back. I'm done with this world. 
kazuma_jersey: Tell Aqua not to resurrect me. 
eris: What?! 
eris: But it seems she's already begun preparations to—
aqua_winter: Kazuma, can you hear me? Megumin dealt with the mushrooms with her explosion magic.
aqua_winter: And now they're prepared perfectly! It smells delicious, so you gotta come back down and make me tempura! 
kazuma_jersey: Hmph. 
aqua_winter: Kazuma, are you listening? I'm almost ready to resurrect you, so you'd better show your gratitude when you're back!
kazuma_jersey: Forget it. Not doing it. I've had enough of this world! I don't wanna die to a stupid vegetable ever again. 
aqua_winter: What are you talking about, Kazuma?! I'm bringing you back! 
kazuma_jersey: Not happening! 
kazuma_jersey: Save me, Lady Eris! Please, Goddess Eris!
eris: I-I, um... 
aqua_winter: Eris? If you're there, I trust you know better that to go against me!
eris: Eeep! I-I'm so sorry, Kazuma!
kazuma_jersey: L-Lady Eris? 
kazuma_jersey: Where are you going, Lady Eris?! 
aqua_winter: Resurrection! 
kazuma_jersey: Are you telling me I have no say in thiiiiiis?! 
eris: I will pray for your safety.
