Home Again with These Pumpkins! P6 
Pumpkin Pillar: Hrrrnggg... 
aqua_halloween2: They haven't said a word since trying the kakiage. I hope they're not mad. 
Amy_halloween: They do look a bit upset. 
darkness: Do you think so? I think they always look like that. 
Pumpkin Pillar: This is horrible...!
kazuma_halloween: Wha—?! 
miia_halloween: Horrible?! Are y'all a buncha dummies? 
miia_halloween: Kazuma's tempura is super yummy!
Amy_halloween: Mia! If the pumpkins didn't like the food, then that means 
Amy_halloween: this town is... 
Adventurer A: We're done for! If the pumpkins get serious, they could destroy a town this size in no time!
Adventurer B: If I'd known this would happen, I'd have eaten my whole dinner last night! 
Adventurer C: I would've confessed my feelings before it was too late! 
darkness: Everyone, calm down! We don't know what's happening yet! 
Pumpkin Pillar: That's right. You will listen to our words, humans. 
kazuma_halloween: Uh-oh. 
Pumpkin Pillar: It truly is horrible. Eating this delicious food makes all other foods bland and unsatisfying! Truly a horrifying situation! 
Pumpkin Pillar: And yet...we find ourselves unable to stop! *Munch munch* IT'S SO DELICIOUS! 
kazuma_halloween: YESSS!!! 
Adventurer A: He did it! That makes two years in a row!
Adventurer B: I'm going to live... I'm actually going to live! 
Pumpkin Pillar: Who knew food could continue to be so delicious? Thank you for the meal. 
Pumpkin Pillar: We shall see you again next year. 
Pumpkin: Pum-pum-pumpkin... 
Amy_halloween: You did it, Kazuma! 
kazuma_halloween: We managed to scrape by again this year! But... 
megumin: They said they'd be back next year. 
aqua_halloween2: You know what? That's a future-us problem. For now... 
miia_halloween: The festival!!!
Announcement: Great work, everyone! In celebration of successfully driving off the pumpkins, our parade will begin shortly!
Adventurers: YEAAAAAAHHH!!! 
miia_halloween: Trick-or-treat! Gimme candy or I'll play a trick on you!
Adventurer A: Well hello there, Mia. Here are some sweets for a little sweetie. Enjoy! 
Adventurer B: Have the whole basket! Anything for a member of Kazuma the Pumpkin Slayer's party.
miia_halloween: Wow... There's just so many sweets! 
miia_halloween: I'm in heaven!
darkness: After all the tempura you ate, I'm astounded by the size of your stomach. 
kazuma_halloween: I'm gonna pinch your cheeks when you gain weight from all that candy. 
Amy_halloween: That's not a problem. Chubby Mia would be even cuter! 
aqua_halloween2: Oh, Amy. Where did you get off to? 
Amy_halloween: Sorry for the wait. I was making everyone food. 
miia_halloween: Whoa! More food!
megumin: What an inspiring spread! 
kazuma_halloween: Can she really eat all this? 
miia_halloween: There's always room for Amy's cooking! 
Amy_halloween: Hehe, your words warm my heart. 
Amy_halloween: Everyone, won't you join us? 
megumin: *Munch munch* Wow!  
megumin: Now I understand why those pumpkins liked this kakiage so much! It's so soft, yet also crispy! 
darkness: Yeah, this is delicious. The pumpkin pudding simple melts in your mouth. 
Amy_halloween: There's plenty more, so please help yourself. 
aqua_halloween2: Halloween is only just getting started! 
aqua_halloween2: What do you say we take another lap of the parade?!
miia_halloween: Hooray! If I do another lap, I'll haffmffmm! 
miia_halloween: Trick or tre— 
miia_halloween: *Cough cough*
kazuma_halloween: Calm down, there's no need to be in such a rush. 
kazuma_halloween: Here, drink some water.
ナレーション: After doing what he could for the entire town, Kazuma finally had a chance to enjoy the Halloween festivities.
